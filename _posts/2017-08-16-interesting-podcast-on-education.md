A break from recursions and algorithms for today! But still sticking to the broader goal of education and learning. I am a big fan of radio programs and in particular NPR. Over the weekend, I happened to listen to a very interesting program on education. Hosted by [Guy Raz](http://www.npr.org/people/6597623/guy-raz), last week's episode of [TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/) focussed on education and learning - specifically how it is changing with technology. It was a very interesting podcast and I really encourage all of you to make some time to listen to it. Below is a link to the podcast.

It is an added motivation for me to use more avenues to share my knowledge with the many in this world, as much as I learn through the many channels and from the many wonderful people on this planet.
