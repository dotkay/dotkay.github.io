Keeping up with my modest goals from the [previous post](), I started looking at Google's product portfolio. 
* Why Google? - Why not? 
* Why their product portfolio? - there is such a rich variety catering to different customer segments. 
* Why for this topic (analysing how machine learning and/or deep learning will impact/improve the products)? - Because we already see the impact (like Google translate, maps, etc.)

Here's their product portfolio, right from their webpage:

<br>
<div class="img_container">
![Google Product Portfolio](/assets/images/products/G_product_portfolio.png){:class="img=responsive"}
</div>

In future posts, we will pick products from this list and analyze.
