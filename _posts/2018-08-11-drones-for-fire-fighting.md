While driving back from a camping along with my friends and looking at the vast possibly burnt areas, we started thinking why even in the _so called_ hot bed of technology (Silicon Valley) we [hear](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/30/why-planes-cant-fight-shastas-deadly-carr-fire/) that fire fighting aircrafts had visibility problems because of the dense smoke. Why can't we use autonomous drone technology for fighting wild fires (given that we use unmanned drones for warfare). Something to think about seriously.
