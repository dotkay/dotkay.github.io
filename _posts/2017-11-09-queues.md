Let's look at another important data structure - the _Queue_. As the name indicates, it is used just to model a queue of objects. The collection of objects in the queue will be served (or processed) much like how a queue of people in front of a ticket vending counter are served - the first one in the queue gets served first, and the last one in the queue gets served last. This kind of system is more popularly called _FIFO_ (for First-In-First-Out system). Queue, is just a collection of objects - which means we can use an array to model them (to hold the objects) or alternatively we could also use a linked list (which also just holds a collection of objects). The operations on those objects should follow the FIFO order, while the container itself could be anything. Let use first model it using an array:

{% highlight cpp %}
#define MAXSIZE 100
class Queue {
  private:
    int front, rear;
    int arr[MAXSIZE];
  public:
    Queue ();
    void enqueue (int item);
    int dequeue ();
    bool is_empty ();
};

Queue::Queue () {
  front = 0;
  rear = -1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

We have two private members - _front_ and _rear_ - _front_ gets served first. Objects get added to the container using the _enqueue()_ method and they get processed in FIFO order using _dequeue()_ method. We will look at these operations in future posts.
