This is my first post. I will keep this a very short one - nothing interesting to read and learn. The internet is a wonderful place. I learnt a lot by browsing interesting blogs, tutorials, asking questions on the various sites, twitter, etc. and it imperative that I give back to the community that helps me learn continuously. I am hoping to be regular with this effort at learning by teaching the many subjects and topics that interest me. Let's see how much I can keep up and how much I can learn.
