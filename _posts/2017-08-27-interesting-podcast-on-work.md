Lately, I have been thinking a lot about my work - my daily job. Most of us have one, where we slog every day, working late into the night or all night. We may have complaints, dissatisfactions, pleasant and unpleasant experiences, awesome career growths or non-existence of such a thing, lots of learning or nothing at all, great colleagues, teams, workplace issues, and the list goes on. I listened to an interesting podcast on "Meaning of work" from [TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/) several months ago and listened to it once again over this weekend.

Whatever your situation is, this is a great podcast to listen to. And if you're a manager, there are important lessons for you too, if you are someone willing to listen and learn.
