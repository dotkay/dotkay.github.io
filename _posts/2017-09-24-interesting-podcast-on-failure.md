Just as I am introspecting whether there's anything I have done that I can call 'success', I happened to listen to this interesting podcast on *Failure* in TED Radio hour. There is a lot to think about - *success*, *impact*, *power* - we know these attractive words and we probably have been measuring each of this using a completely wrong yard-stick. If we start thinking about the times we have failed and failed miserably, and how we have overcome some of the disastrous failures (that's actually our *success* but we fail to realize it that way...), that is what prepares us for success and makes us powerful.

For those interested, below is a link to the podcast:

Hopefully, I will keep learning and continue to improve my work-in-progress project (my life) and get better every day of the project.
