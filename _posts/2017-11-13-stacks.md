In this post, we introduce _Stack_ - a data structure closely related to _Queue_. It differs however in the order of operations that we perform on the constituent elements. While queue provided a _FIFO_ (First-In-First-Out) order of processing, stack provides us _LIFO_ (Last-In-First-Out), just as you would pick the last element that you put on the stack before picking out the other elements - just like in the stack of books below, it is very likely you added the blue book on the top very recently (Last-In) and you would pick out this book (on the _top of the stack_ - First-Out) before picking out, say, the green books.

Again, as with queues, we can use an _array_ or a _linked list_ to store our elements. Let use see how to define a Stack class using an array implementation.

{% highlight cpp %}
#define MAXSIZE 100
class Stack {
  int top;           // top of the stack
  int arr[MAXSIZE];  // array that implements the stack
  
  public:
    Stack ();

    bool push (int item);
    int pop ();
    int top_of_stack ();
    bool is_empty ();
};

Stack::Stack () {
  top = -1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

We add elements to our stack using the _push()_ method, remove elements from the stack (actually from the top of our stack) using _pop()_ method, and we also keep track of the top of the stack because that's where interesting actions happen.

We will see the different methods in the following posts. Stay tuned!.
