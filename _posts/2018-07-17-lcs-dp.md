LCS algorithm can also be implemented in a bottom-up fashion. That is, we can start from the simplest subproblem and build up the solution by progressively solving bigger problems. Instead of a hash-table we use a 2D array (2D as we would be tracking the lengths of sequences seen so far in the two input strings). 

Suppose we are given two strings *s1* and *s2* of lengths *m* and *n* respectively. The base case corresponds to one of the strings being empty, in which case we do not have any common subsequence and just return 0.

{% highlight cpp %}
std::vector<std::vector<int>> lookup(m+1, std::vector<int>(n+1));
 for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
    lookup[i][0] = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)
    lookup[0][j] = 0;
{% endhighlight %}

We would use the above solutions (to the smallest subproblems) to progressively scan the two strings *s1* and *s2* looking which characters are matching, very similar to the approach seen [previously](https://dotkay.github.io/2018/07/13-lcs-mem).

Putting it together,

{% highlight cpp %}
int lcs_r(std::string s1, std::string s2, int m, int n)
{
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> lookup(m+1, std::vector<int>(n+1));

  for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
    lookup[i][0] = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)
    lookup[0][j] = 0;

  if (m == 0 || n == 0)
    return 0;
  
  if (s1[m - 1] == s2[n - 1])
    lookup[m][n] = lcs_r(s1, s2, m - 1, n - 1) + 1;
  else
    lookup[m][n] = std::max(lcs_r(s1, s2, m - 1, n),
                            lcs_r(s1, s2, m, n - 1));
  return lookup[m][n];
}
{% endhighlight %}
