LCS algorithm can also be implemented in a bottom-up fashion. That is, we can start from the simplest subproblem and build up the solution by progressively solving bigger problems. Instead of a hash-table we use a 2D array (2D as we would be tracking the lengths of sequences seen so far in the two input strings). 

Suppose we are given two strings *s1* and *s2* of lengths *m* and *n* respectively. The base case corresponds to one of the strings being empty, in which case we do not have any common subsequence and just return 0.

{% highlight cpp %}
int lookup[m+1][n+1];
for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
  lookup[i][0] = 0;
for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)
  lookup[0][j] = 0;
{% endhighlight %}

We would use the above solutions (to the smallest subproblems) to progressively scan the two strings *s1* and *s2* looking which characters are matching, very similar to the approach seen [previously](https://dotkay.github.io/2018/07/13/lcs-mem).

Putting it together,

{% highlight cpp %}
int lcs_dp(std::string s1, std::string s2, int m, int n)
{
  int lookup[m+1][n+1];

  for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
    lookup[i][0] = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)
    lookup[0][j] = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)
  {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++)
    {
      if (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1])
        lookup[i][j] = lookup[i-1][j-1] + 1;
      else
        lookup[i][j] = std::max(lookup[i-1][j], lookup[i][j-1]);
    }
  }
  return lookup[m][n];
}
{% endhighlight %}
