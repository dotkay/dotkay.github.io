Let us chat about _Modular Arithmetic_ - let's start with a fun question that I actually happened to read in one of my textbooks on Algorithms. 

> Suppose you binge watch an entire season of some television show in one sitting, starting at midnight and suppose there are 25 episodes of the show, each lasting 3 hours. At what time of the day will you be done?

So, you start at midnight and watch for `25 x 3 = 75` hours non-stop. Since our clocks reset every 24 hours (Othewise, we would need several million digits to say the time!), we divide 75 into chunks of 24 hours, which is to say we compute _modulo 24_ and `75 mod 24  = 3` and so we will finish at 3 am. The way to think about modular arithmetic is to think of something that restricts numbers to a predefined range `{0, 1, ..., N-1}`.

Modular arithmetic has some beautiful properties that are very useful in several application domains, especially cryptography. We will get to learn about them in future posts.
