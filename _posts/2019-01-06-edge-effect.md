On this rainy Sunday in California, with not much motivation to do anything serious, with the last of the India-Australia Test series underway in Sydney delayed due to rain, I started scrolling through the library of my favourite pod-casts and this particular one caught my attention. _The Edge Effect_ - an episode from NPR's [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain) series. 

The episode talks about the importance of encouraging and developing diversity of thoughts and ideas. It draws examples from science and music and makes compelling arguments supporting diversity. In particular, the experiments by Adam Galinsky and the life story of Cristina Pato were very impressive. 

For those interested, here is a link to the podcast:

I should take time to appreciate the diversity my parents exposed me to, while growing up in India.
