I happened to complete an online course on Deep Learning and just starting to look at different products to see how machine learning or deep learning techniques could be used to make these products better. Since I understand technology products and their landscape better, I am likely to be biased in analysing more technology products than non-tech ones, although I am determined to study some non-tech industries, processes, products and services to see if (at all) and how deep learning could be used there - that is a bigger challenge and one that would stimulate our neurons more. Let's see how I fare ...
