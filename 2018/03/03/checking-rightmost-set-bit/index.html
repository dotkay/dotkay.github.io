  <title>How to find out the position of the right-most set bit in a bit-vector?</title>
  <meta name="description" content="As we are getting comfortable thinking in terms of bits and bit-wise operators, let us play with them some more. Let us see how to find the position of the right-most set bit, given a bit-vector? Note that this is different from the previous problem of checking if the bit in a specific bit position is set. Here, we want to just find the right most set bit, and the position in the bit-vector is not given - we are to find that position. For example, 10 in binary is 1010 and the right-most set bit is at position 2 (second from the right most digit). Given 10, our algorithm has to output 2. Similarly, 8 in binary is 1000 and given this, our algorithm has to output 4. The intuition is that since multiple bits may be set in a bit-vector (unless it is a power of 2) we need to find a way of isolating the right-most set bit and then traverse the vector to find its position in the vector. For example, suppose a bit-vector (with the right-most bit of 10 isolated) is given to us, it would look like 0010. Now we can write a simple algorithm to check the bit-position of the only bit (the lonely, isolated bit) set in the vector. We already know that we could use right shift operator repeatedly on this bit-vector, until it becomes 0, as follows: 0010 -&amp;gt; given bit-vector with only one bit set 0010 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1 -&amp;gt; right-shift by 1 position (once) 0001 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1 -&amp;gt; right-shift by 1 position (twice) 0000 Quite intuitively, the number of right-shifts we needed to apply is the position of the only set bit. Let us write that as a C algorithm: int count = 0; while (x != 0) // check for 0 { x = x &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1; // right-shift count++; // maintain count } return count; Now, what operation do we use to find this x above? Or referring to our example, how do we find the vector 0010 that gave us the right-most set bit for our input vector which was 1010? Think about the properties of bit-vectors, especially negative numbers. Stay tuned for a post describing it.">

    <p>As we are getting comfortable thinking in terms of bits and bit-wise operators, let us play with them some more. Let us see how to find the position of the right-most set bit, given a bit-vector? Note that this is different from the <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2018/03/02/checking-set-bit">previous</a> problem of checking if the bit in a specific bit position is set. Here, we want to just find the right most set bit, and the position in the bit-vector is not given - we are to find that position.</p>

<p>For example, 10 in binary is <code class="highlighter-rouge">1010</code> and the right-most set bit is at position 2 (second from the right most digit). Given 10, our algorithm has to output 2. Similarly, 8 in binary is <code class="highlighter-rouge">1000</code> and given this, our algorithm has to output 4.</p>

<p>The intuition is that since multiple bits may be set in a bit-vector (unless it is a power of 2) we need to find a way of isolating the right-most set bit and then traverse the vector to find its position in the vector. For example, suppose a bit-vector (with the right-most bit of 10 isolated) is given to us, it would look like <code class="highlighter-rouge">0010</code>. Now we can write a simple algorithm to check the bit-position of the only bit (the lonely, isolated bit) set in the vector. We already know that we could use right shift operator repeatedly on this bit-vector, until it becomes 0, as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>0010           -&gt; given bit-vector with only one bit set
0010 &gt;&gt; 1      -&gt; right-shift by 1 position (once)
0001 &gt;&gt; 1      -&gt; right-shift by 1 position (twice)
0000  
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Quite intuitively, the number of right-shifts we needed to apply is the position of the only set bit.</p>

<p>Let us write that as a C algorithm:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">// check for 0</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// right-shift</span>
    <span class="n">count</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>    <span class="c1">// maintain count</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Now, what operation do we use to find this x above? Or referring to our example, how do we find the vector <code class="highlighter-rouge">0010</code> that gave us the right-most set bit for our input vector which was <code class="highlighter-rouge">1010</code>? Think about the properties of bit-vectors, especially negative numbers.</p>
