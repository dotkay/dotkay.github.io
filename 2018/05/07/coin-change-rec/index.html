  <title>Do you have some change?</title>
  <meta name="description" content="In a previous post, we saw a recursive algorithm for computing the number of ways to reach atop n stairs. Let’s do a similar computation, this time for computing the number of ways you can combine coin denominations to arrive at a given amount. More precisely: Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, how many ways can you combine the denominations in such a way that the combination sums up to the target amount? You can assume that you have unlimited supply of denominations. For example, if you have unlimited supply of $1 and $2 currency bills, how many ways can you combine them to return a change for $3? You could give three $1 bills, or a $1 bill along with a $2 bill (or alternately, a $2 bill along with a $1 bill, which is just a duplicate of the previous case just that I kept the $2 bill upon the $1 bill while giving). Let us think recursively. Given a set S = {$1, $2} of bills, we could pick a $1 bill (to give) and now we have to think how many ways you can pick bills from our set S for the remaining amount of $2 ($3 the target amount - $1, the bill we already picked). Now, if you choose to pick another $1 bill, you have to think how many ways you can pick bills from our set S for the remaining amount of $1 ($3 the target amount - our first picked $1 - our second $1 pick). Now, we cannot pick $2 as we need only $1 and are just left with one choice - to pick another $1 from the set. This gives us one solution { $1, $1, $1 }. Alternately, we could have first picked a $2 bill and then we would be left with no choice but to pick another $1, so that it adds up to $3. What we are essentially doing is picking a bill whose value is less than the target amount and then computing the number of ways you can pick bills for the remaining amount, i.e. target amount - picked bill amount (our recursive step). And if this difference becomes 0, then we have a solution that sums up to the target amount (our base case for recursion). int coin_ways(std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&amp;amp; S, int n, int target) { // base case if (target &amp;lt; 0) return 0; if (target == 0) return 1; int ways = 0; for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++) { ways += coin_ways(S, n, target - S[i]); } return ways; } If you try the above implementation on our example with S = { 1, 2 } and target = 3, you will get ways to be 3. And the three ways are { 1, 1, 1 }, { 1, 2 } and { 2, 1 }. What if we want only the unique ways? How would you go about modifying the above algorithm? That is we want to collapse { 1, 2 } and { 2, 1 } as just one count - after all it does not matter if I keep the $1 bill upon $2 bill or the other way around as long as I am returning bills that sum up to $3. Think about it.">

    <p>In a <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2018/05/05/climbing-stairs-recursively">previous post</a>, we saw a recursive algorithm for computing the number of ways to reach atop <em>n</em> stairs.
