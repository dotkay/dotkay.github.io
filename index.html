          <p>Allez les Bleus!!</p>

<p>Just happened to listen to this week’s episode of one of the recent NPR podcast series titled <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain">Hidden Brain</a> and it got me thinking a lot. I speak almost 5 languages (not fluently but to different degrees of expertise) and I am not sure how my mind thinks. One thing for sure though is that I happen to think in my mother tongue and my mind translates it in (almost) real-time while I communicate, be it talking or writing down my thoughts as I do while writing this blog post. If languages do influence our thinking and understanding and more importantly the biases we cultivate, what does it mean for language translators - do they also convey the biases that are inherently influenced by one’s language? Or as a technologist I am also inclined to think what would it mean for AI systems (say chat-bots) that are meant to facilitate communication? I now tend to believe that they have to be designed with the intricacies of languages and the influences, biases that it carries along encoded into the system in order for it to be more acceptable. Even if not as a chat-bot, it would be a great system to train people to work with people of different cultures so that we understand different cultures better and comfortably communicate taking into account their nuances.</p>

          <p>Let us look at some fundamental data structures which are just a collection of primitive data types. For example, an array of integers is a collection of integers, a string is a collection of characters, etc.</p>

<p>Here, we are interested in <em>Linked Lists</em> which are just a collection (<em>list</em>) made by linking together some data-types (<em>node</em>). The data-types themselves could be any primitive or a data-type formed of primitive types. For simplicity, we will discuss linked lists of integer nodes. The building block of the linked list is a <em>node</em> and nodes are chained (linked) together using pointers, just a data-type that stores the address of the next node. The following sketch would explain it better.</p>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/data_structures/linked_lists_intro.png =200px" alt="Linked List" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p>Here is how you would describe a node and a linked list as C++ classes:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Node</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">public</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">Node</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">next</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">public</span><span class="o">:</span> 
    <span class="n">Node</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">item</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We denote the fist node of the list as “head” node which will come handy when we have operations that traverse the list. The next pointer just stores the address of the next node, as shown in the image below.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">LinkedList</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">private</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="n">Node</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="c1">// constructors and member functions

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Today, let us see how to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given input numbers. Although it is a very easy problem with a relatively straight-forward implementation, the beauty of the problem is that the algorithm was discovered more than 2000 years ago by a Greek mathematician Euclid, after whom the algorithm is named.</p>

<p>It uses the concept of modular arithmetic as discussed in the <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2017/10/08/mod-arith">previous post</a>. Put simply, the <em>gcd</em> of two given integers x and y is just the greatest number that divides both x and y. For example, the greatest common divisor of both 6 and 9 is 3. The obvious approach to compute the <em>gcd</em> if two given numbers is to factor both the numbers, pick out the common factors and multiply them. For example, 6 = 1 x 2 x 3 and 9 = 1 x 3 x 3, and the common factors being 1 and 3. Euclid’s algorithm uses the following formula:</p>

<p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">x &gt;= y</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">gcd(x, y) = gcd(x mod y, y)</code>. As you see, the recursion is built in the description itself. Here’s an implementation:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">euclid_gcd</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// base case
</span>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">euclid_gcd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>One has to note that in the recursive call, the first argument became <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> and the second <code class="highlighter-rouge">x mod y</code>. This is because of the following lemma:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">x &gt;= y</code>, then <code class="highlighter-rouge">x mod y &lt; x/2</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the arguments x and y decrease with each recursive call. The applications of modular arithmetic is very wide, some of which we will see in future posts.</p>

          <p>Let us chat about <em>Modular Arithmetic</em> - let’s start with a fun question that I actually happened to read in one of my textbooks on Algorithms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you binge watch an entire season of some television show in one sitting, starting at midnight and suppose there are 25 episodes of the show, each lasting 3 hours. At what time of the day will you be done?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you start at midnight and watch for <code class="highlighter-rouge">25 x 3 = 75</code> hours non-stop. Since our clocks reset every 24 hours (Othewise, we would need several million digits to say the time!), we divide 75 into chunks of 24 hours, which is to say we compute <em>modulo 24</em> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">75 mod 24  = 3</code> and so we will finish at 3 am. The way to think about modular arithmetic is to think of something that restricts numbers to a predefined range <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">0,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">1,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">...,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">N-1</span><span class="p">}</span></code>.</p>

<p>Modular arithmetic has some beautiful properties that are very useful in several application domains, especially cryptography. We will get to learn about them in future posts.</p>
