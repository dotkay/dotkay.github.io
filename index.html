        <div class="post-content">
          <p>When a Deep Learning <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/artificial-intelligence-identifies-new-antibiotic-0220">algorithm invented Halicin</a>, there was instant speculation about the ability of Deep Learning algorithms to discover new knowledge which in this case was a new antibiotic compound. This compound also seemed to have a new structure that was different from existing antibiotic compounds. Does this constitute new knowledge? Of course, it does. After all, the structure of the compound was not known earlier. This is akin to solving a Sudoku puzzle by searching through an enormous search space and arriving at a solution. The solution <em>is</em> new knowledge - depending on the way you look at it.</p>

<p>While AI systems today are more akin to <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2023/01/26/analogy-machines-reasoning"><em>analogy machines</em> than <em>reasoning machines</em></a> there is an intense debate about what kind of a machine would lead us to our quest of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - is the ability to reason needed at all? After all, human beings ourselves learn more through experiences and we reason more from our past experiences than from the rule book. However, according to Stanislas Dehaene’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-We-Learn-Brains-Machine/dp/0525559884"><em>How We Learn</em></a> we have certain intuition built into our brain that enables us to learn abstract concepts. In his book, he notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Characteristic of the human species is a relentless search for abstract rules, high-level conclusions that are extracted from a specific situation and subsequently tested on new observations 
…
Learning means managing an internal hierarchy of rules and trying to infer the most general ones that summarize a whole series of observations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This looks similar to logical reasoning (in the sense of mathematical logic in the realm of formal methods) where conclusions are inferred from hypotheses using a sequence of deduction rules. In order to illustrate this, let me pick one of the puzzles from <a href="https://www.tptp.org/">TPTP library</a> - the <em>Aunt Agatha</em> puzzle which is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Someone who lives in Dreadbury Mansion killed Aunt Agatha. Agatha, the butler, and Charles live in Dreadbury Mansion, and are the only people who live therein. A killer always hates his victim, and is never richer than his victim. Charles hates no one that Aunt Agatha hates. Agatha hates everyone except the butler. The butler hates everyone not richer than Aunt Agatha. The butler hates everyone Aunt Agatha hates. No one hates everyone. Agatha is not the butler. Therefore: Agatha killed herself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If one were to encode the given facts in mathematical logic and prove the conclusion (the conjecture that Agatha killed herself) is deducible from the given facts, say in a theorem prover (like Vampire), it would be able to not only prove the conjecture, the <em>logical reasoning system</em> in Vampire would be able to show the sequence of steps that was used to arrive at the conclusion from the assumptions.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>29. lives(sK0) [cnf transformation 26]
30. killed(sK0,agatha) [cnf transformation 26]
...
...
...
79. ~hates(butler,butler) [superposition 41,78]
...
...
82. hates(charles,agatha) &lt;- (1) [backward demodulation 44,57]
89. ~hates(agatha,agatha) &lt;- (1) [resolution 82,37]
...
...
93. $false [avatar sat refutation 66,71,81,92]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A Vampire proof run would also discover new knowledge (i.e. new facts not explicitly stated in our input set of facts). For example, it could deduce that the butler does not hate himself (line 79 above) which is not explicitly mentioned in the set of assumptions (derived from our natural natural language text). Such a kind of logical reasoning would be a great cornerstone for <em>explainable AI systems</em> of the future. However, languages themselves are ambiguous and translating from an ambiguous natural language into an unambiguous formulas in first order logic (as in this case) is not a trivial task. Maybe, just maybe one could generate such formulas themselves by training a model using a large corpus of natual language text and the corresponding logical formulas that would be able to capture the essence of natual language statements, context, etc. in logical form.</p>

<p>Note that the present day AI systems though demonstrate exemplary generative skills across text, images and video, the content generated, though novel in some cases, is an emergent behavior that arises from the vast knowledge base the model was trained on. Hence, it still lacks the capability to reason how it generated a particular content (it can not produce a sequence of deductions for example).</p>

<p>A symbiotic combination of logical reasoning and analogy based reasoning would enable both an efficient generation of impressive content while at the same time being able to reason about the chain of thought involved in the process. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08860">GreaseLM</a> and <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/ren21a.html">LEGO</a> are research efforts towards infusing reasoning capabilities in language models. They however work on pruning and traversing a knowledge graph based on the context from embedding vectors, rather than translating the knowledge into formulas in mathematical logic. AI systems that need to solve problems in mathematics and to derive <em>new knowledge</em> in the form of new mathematical proofs or conjectures would need more rigour and encoding the knowledge of mathematics in the form of logical formulas and training AI systems on such a corpus could be one way of achieving reasoning capabilities. Besides solving competitive math problems, such systems might be able to discover new physical structures that are lighter and stronger, or better algorithms that are currently unknown, better deterministic optimal algorithms in the place of present day heuristics, or even proofs of non-existence of better algorithms for certain problems.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>The foundations for reasoning about computer algorithms predate the development of computer programming languages themselves. In fact, <em>logic</em> itself was developed in order to make arguments and discourse in natural language in a rigorous and structured manner so as to be able to reason about them. The word <em>logic</em> itself originates from the Greek word <em>logos</em> which could be loosely translated to <em>reason</em>, <em>discourse</em> or <em>language</em> and it involves the study of <em>rules of thought</em> or <em>rules of reasoning</em>. This allowed to deduce conclusions from a set of premises in a logical and structured way, removing many of the ambiguities. For a long time however, logic (in particular mathematical logic) was used to advance the field of programming languages - in particular to reason about the correctness of algorithms (erstwhile AI - symbolic AI or symbolic reasoning) given the various data structures provided by the different programming languages. When you think about it the tool (<em>mathematical logic</em>) that was developed to help in reasoning about natural languages made way to develop tools for more constrained language, with strict syntax and mostly strict semantics. In the last decade this has turned around and advances in algorithms, data and computation have enabled building systems that could understand natural language and attempt to reason about them.</p>

<p>We see two approaches to automated artificial intelligence:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Reasoning Engines:</em> Based on <em>rules</em> or mathematical logic that allows one to reason about (give mathematical proofs) following rigorously established rules of mathematics and semantics of languages. This was the erstwhile AI that had several winters from 1950s to 1980s as data was expensive (there were no smartphone cameras) and computation was very expensive (there were no GPU data-centers).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Analogy Machines:</em> Based on <em>patterns</em> seen in large amounts of similar data. The rise of inexpensive sensors (cameras) and proliferation of computing (smartphones) and internet enabled vast amount of data to pattern match (i.e. learn) from.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Is <em>reasoning</em> the core of intelligence as we usually think? Or would analogy machines turn out to be the <em>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</em> that everyone is racing for? Or would it be a powerful system that is able to automate several tasks and develop new impactful discoveries for mankind - like <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/artificial-intelligence-identifies-new-antibiotic-0220">Halicin</a>, but still not able to deduce everything that human minds are capable of? There is an intense ongoing debate between Computer Scientists, Philosophers, Neuroscientists, medical doctors, religious leaders and of course the general public about if the magnificient advancements in <em>analogy machines</em>, henceforth Deep Learning, one day lead to true AGI and what would positive and negative impacts of such a system be.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Prof. Geoffrey Hinton a Turing award winning Computer Scientist claims that <em>reasoning</em> may not be the core of intelligence and that there are things similar to <em>vectors</em> in the brain that are just patterns of activities that interact with one another. This is similar to <em>word embeddings</em> in large language models (LLMs). There is a fantastic study about holographic memory by <a href="https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/karl-lashley">Prof. Karl Lashley</a> who experimented with rats’ behavior in mazes and concluded that <em>all</em> information is stored <em>everywhere</em> in a distributed fashion and even if one part of the memory gets damaged one has access to <em>all</em> of the information.</p>

<p>Prof. Hinton contrasted symbolic reasoning and analogical reasoning and claimed that reasoning is easy when done using symbolic reasoning but perception is hard. It is hard to encode what we perceive into logical statements without introducing ambiguity. He claims that the reasoning employed by human beings is almost always <em>analogical reasoning</em> - reasoning by making analogies. Languages themselves are abstractions - they are just an approximate encoding for communicating our thoughts and not the actual representation of our thoughts. Hence different human beings might convey the same thought in different ways. The languages themselves as employed by us are just pointers to the vectors in our brain (similar to the weights in LLMs  that point to embedding vectors).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is quite likely we will get some kind of symbiosis. AI will make us far more competent. It is changing our view of what we are … it is changing people’s view from the idea that the essence of a person is a deliberate reasoning machine; the essence is much more a huge analogy machine … that seems far more like our real nature, than reasoning machines   – Geoffrey Hinton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There used to be research interest in identifying which language constructs would make the best compiler or the best programming language and Computer scientists have looked at languages like <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~huet/PUBLIC/Panini_machine.pdf">Sanskrit</a> to and deconstruct <a href="https://bhavana.org.in/computing-processes-and-pan%CC%A3inis-as%CC%A3t%CC%A3adhyayi/">Panini’s rules</a>.</p>

<p>However, languages themselves are not the same as are human thoughts and expressions of thoughts. Some languages have ways of expressing things that certain other languages do not. Some people have ways of articulating their thoughts that many others do not. Given this large variance, I am waiting to see how long before LLMs can become a more effective teacher or a more effective comedian.</p>

<p>I am also waiting to see what would be the best language for a machine to express thoughts would be - would it even be a textual language or would it be a visual one? Conversely what would be the best mode to communicate with an analogy machine be? How would you reason about what analogies it used to arrive at a prediction and in what sequence or order it used the analogies - much like a deductive reasoning engine for programming languages.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>A few years ago, when Machine Learning was at its infancy, <em>feature engineering</em> used to be the swiss army knife for getting great results out of the models. Many <em>domain experts</em>, who claimed to know which features were important and which features weren’t important for a particular problem, became widely sought after. From a handful of features for predicting housing prices, like number of rooms, square footage, Zipcode, etc., to several hundreds of millions of features that might be present in a typical social media feed recommendation system, model features have grown at an impressive rate, thanks to the many varieties of inexpensive sensors and of course the distribution power of the internet. <em>Feature Engineering</em> became a role on its own in many companies that were building machine learning models. An automobile engineer would know which features are relevant or important to the stability of a car, while a grocery retailer would know about which items when placed at specific aisles in the store would garner more interest. Unsurprisingly, this also led to considerable interest from academia and subsequently there were more efficient techniques formalized and developed for effective <em>feature selection</em> based on the problem at hand and <em>feature construction</em> and <em>feature extraction</em> from raw data. Engineering teams started developing tools that facilitated such processes - like <a href="https://www.featuretools.com/">Featuretools</a> for Python.</p>

<p>Fast forward a decade, feature engineering seems to be less in fashion while <em>prompt engineering</em> has captured the podium. This is primarily due to the interest and advancement in large language models. While earlier machine learning models were built to solve specific problems and hence needed domain experts to curate the features that best helps the model, advancements in few shot learning made selecting specific features less and less relevant while maintaining the same accuracy of the model. Today, models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and the like can work on a variety of domains as they are trained on a collective dataset (dataset from as many different domains as possible) and hence have captured the relationships between the different domains by attaching weights to the learned contexts as did the previous machine learning algorithms that attached weights to different features. A word like <em>teddy</em> would be identified with a context of <em>toys</em> more (larger weights) while the data is about donations to charity for helping children. The same word however would be identified with a context of <em>politics</em> while the data is about national parks and national forests.</p>

<p>For example, experimenting with <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, when the system is prompted with the following question, it prompts back asking for clarifications, in order to identify the context.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>user: Can you tell me about teddy?
ChatGPT: I'm sorry, but without additional context, I'm not sure which "teddy" you're referring to. 
There are several possible meanings for the word "teddy," such as:
...
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The user might give an indirect context that the system still identifies with the initial prompt (<em>teddy</em>) - i.e. the system has memory and it retrieves the weights from its collection of different contexts, much like an indexing system would retrieve the best page among a collection of pages related to a search keyword.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>user: tell me about the teddy related to national parks and forests
ChatGPT: Theodore Roosevelt is closely associated with the conservation movement in the United States and is often referred 
to as the "Conservation President." During his presidency from 1901 to 1909, he took significant steps to protect natural 
resources, establish national parks, and preserve wilderness areas.
...
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The user could still prompt the system with a subsequent string that could entirely change the course of the conversation, much like how many real-world informal conversations move around from one topic to another while the topics themselves might be unrelated but tied together by some weak links.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>user: tell me about the teddy related to donations to charity for children
ChatGPT: One possible "teddy" you might be referring to in this context is the "Teddy Bear" charity program. 
The Teddy Bear program is a charitable initiative that collects and distributes teddy bears and other stuffed animals 
to children in need, such as those who are sick, homeless, or traumatized.
The Teddy Bear program was first started by police officers in the United States in ...
...
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The user could ask about an unrelated topic as a subsequent prompt but the system might still try to find a common context and if there is would talk about it, because the subsequent prompts are considered part of the same conversation.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>user: what about fashion?
ChatGPT: In the world of fashion, a "teddy" can refer to a type of lingerie for women. A teddy is a 
one-piece garment that combines a camisole top and panties, often made from silk or other
...
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why is this impressive or important. In many real-world impactful applications (rather than informal chat systems), it is crucial to maintain a conversation topic - think about an airline customer service chatbot or an internet service center or education software where one builds on from simple fundamental concepts to advanced topics that are built by stitching together fundamental concepts. It is also crucial to have the ability to switch to a completely different topic even when there might be a related weak link in the conversation thread. This switch is effected by engineering the prompt in such a way as to turn the system’s attention from it’s current context to a new context.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>user: No, let's just talk about contemporary fashion...
ChatGPT: Certainly! Contemporary fashion is a constantly evolving and diverse industry, encompassing a 
wide range of styles, trends, and designers. Some of the key trends and movements in ...
...
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that <em>prompt engineering</em> gets the job done, is <em>feature engineering</em> irrelevant? Not really. It would still require a domain expert to help train the system with well engineered prompts in order for the system not to stray away. For example, a teacher could help with engineering the right prompts that would make the learning process more effective by not only charting the path to learn - from essential fundamental concepts to more involved concepts, but also in personalizing the path by identifying the learning challenges based on the questions (prompts) from the user (learner). This could be the next revolution in personalized, adaptive learning systems. There could be many other situations where such systems could benefit from domain experts. Some of them include negotiation systems, interviews and management training systems, navigation, technical support, as well as entertainment systems. Adding to this, multi-modal prompting systems, where the prompts themselves would have other modes (like voice, images, etc.) in addition to text would be immensely powerful in many real-world applications. Voice prompts would be very useful for autonomous machines, and image prompts would be exciting for content creation. I am eagerly looking forward to playing with those.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>When we hear about AI applications these days, either companies like NVIDIA or Graphcore is in focus or the companies that develop applications like OpenAI or Meta is in focus. However there are several layers to AI. Understanding what constitutes the different layers and which companies are the key players in any or many of the layers would enable one to identify moats, challenges and growth drivers of such companies. Besides, one could also identify potential for future opportunities for vertical integration and consolidation.</p>

<p>AI had many winters over the last several decades. However, over the last decade AI enabled applications seem to be proliferating and has already been infused with several day to day software applications - like voice assistants, maps, translators, etc. Two key developments that happened over the last couple of decades are chiefly responsible for this proliferation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Availability of data, due to inexpensive sensors (image sensors like camera, messages in social media apps, etc.)</li>
  <li>Availability of compute, due to faster CPUs and GPUs</li>
</ol>

<p>Looking at just the two key components would mislead us to think about just software to process the data and hardware to execute the software. One might want to break it down into further components in order to identify the key players in each of the components.</p>

<p><strong>Layers of AI</strong></p>

</div>

<p><strong>Hardware Accelerator Layer</strong></p>

<p>This is the one of the main layers that brought AI research out of its many winters. <a href="https://inria.hal.science/inria-00112631/document">Kumar’s work</a> at Microsoft Research, <a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/ijcai2011.pdf">Dan Ciresan’s work</a> at IDSIA on accelerating CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) using GPUs followed by the famous <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf">AlexNet work</a> brought attention to the use of hardware acclerators like GPUs for applications that are heavy on matrix computations. GPUs are Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architecture machines that could excel at tasks that are massively parallel. Subsequently, there were other accelerators built based on other architectures like Bulk Synchronous Processing (BSP) (e.g. Graphcore), or Systolic Arrays (e.g. TPUs) that were targeted on accelerating specific architectures. A broad install base as well as accelerators fine tuned over a long period of time to excel at specific deep learning model architectures and deep learning frameworks could serve as a moat that prevents others from having a slice of the market share easily. A good analogy is to think of hardware layer as the muscles that enable heavy computations.</p>

<p><strong>System Software/Compiler Layer</strong></p>

<p>The System Software or Compiler Layer sits closest to the hardware accelerator thereby optimizing the executions of machine instructions as much as possible. CUDA and OpenCL are the programming models closely tied to the software drivers (system software) or compilers. Lately, Graphcore has graph compilers that optimizes the execution of graph networks (using the Poplar SDK) on Graphcore IPUs. There are also companies like Groq that make a much tighter integration between the compiler layer and the hardware layer. In particular, the Groq compiler does all the optimizations on the input model and continuously orchestrates the instructions as operands for those instructions arrive, with the exact knowledge of which hardware execution units are available to execute the instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Model Architecture Layer</strong></p>

<p>It is not often that one can separate out this layer. Once certain model architectures become stabilized, it might make sense to optimize the layers beneath it (hardware and system software layers) in order to serve this particular architecture. The popular architectures might be Transformers for languages, Convolutional Neural Networks for Images, Graph Neural Networks for graph datasets, etc. However, since newer algorithms are still being developed, the current trends are more about optimizing the hardware and system software layers to optimize specific components of the models. The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/03/22/h100-transformer-engine/">Transformer Engine</a> in H100 GPUs would be an example of such an optimization.</p>

<p><strong>Deep Learning (DL) Frameworks Layer</strong></p>

<p>The different DL Frameworks like Tensorflow, PyTorch, JAX, etc. are similar superficially and have over the years become more similar than different. However, there are compiler instrumentations that optimize such frameworks, very much like Groq Compiler, NVIDIA CUDA, OpenAI Triton, etc. Some of the optimizations like operator fusion have been adopted by the DL frameworks like PyTorch by default and many more such optimizations might become default as research and engineering in DL advances. This layer is also important as it might turn out to be critical to the iterative development of algorithms. Most DL algorithms are iterative in nature and having fine grained control over the progress of the experiments in terms of debugging, performance analysis and the like would ultimately determine the popularity, adoption and subsequently advances in such frameworks. For example, PyTorch executes eagerly using dynamic graphs, it was much easier for programmers to monitor. Tensorflow moved to eager execution from later versions. Which framework is best suited is an ongoing debate in the community with academic researchers leaning towards PyTorch and production engineers leaning towards Tensorflow. There have been other frameworks which were popular initially but lost steam over time.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithms Layer</strong></p>

<p>Algorithmic innovations have led to developments in newer, efficient and more effective model architectures. Though some of the algorithms have been known for a very long time (like backpropagation, CNNs, etc.) the development in other layers (availability of general purpose programmable hardware accelerators, easy-to-use DL frameworks and most importantly the availability of data to train the networks) have significantly aided advancements in algorithms. 
This has led to architectures like <em>Transformers</em> with layers like <em>Attention</em> that seem to push forward the state-of-the-art in DL research. However, it wasn’t an easy innovation and it is definitely not the last - researchers tried different architectures from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Sequence-to-Sequence models, etc. before iteratively discovering the bottlenecks and devising newer architectures to optimize those. If one of these algorithms were determined to be the most optimal, it would make sense to bake it in silicon in order to get the most efficient performance. It has not happened yet as one does not know what future architectures would bring in this fast paced world of DL research.</p>

<p><strong>Data Layer</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There were 5 exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every 2 days.”  – <em>Eric Schmidt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Data</em> along with <em>Compute</em> is one of the key drivers of today’s Deep Learning advances. The growth and availability of inexpensive sensors and access to analyze them has put all the algorithms that were developed in theory over the past several decades into practice within a span of a decade. However, as DL applications impermeate more and more of our lives, there would be questions around the source of <em>data</em> the models were trained on and if the data provider was compensated for the same. Further, the emergent behaviors of today’s AI systems are the result of the data they were trained on but without having the ability to trace back the emergent behavior to the data points that led to it. These would be the areas of research that could eventually lead to <em>explainable AI</em> systems that we aspire for.</p>

<p><strong>Reasoning Layer</strong></p>

<p>Different from logical reasoning systems which were referred to as <em>reasoning engines</em>, today’s AI systems are more <em>analogy engines</em> than reasoning ones. The exceptional efficiency and effectiveness of such systems seem to be the result of emergent behavior arising from training these systems on unbelievably vast quantities of data. Even with its effectiveness in language tasks, such AI systems seem to be not so good at logical reasoning. The infusion of logical reasoning behaviors into analogy based reasoning architectures of today’s systems would possibly create effective systems that is also able to reason about its emergent behaviors. Since the research in this area is not very well developed at the time of this writing, it is depicted as a grey box in the image above.</p>

<p><strong>Regulatory Layer</strong></p>

<p>This layer is still an underdeveloped layer (and hence depicted using dotted lines). With recent discussions around the data the systems are trained on and the transparency of algorithms and their explainability, this layer might encompass more than just the data layer and the algorithms layer. In the coming years the systems are likely to get regulated in order to deter inappropriate usage of such systems.</p>

<p>It is indeed a great time for AI - the recent advances in research, several applications and multitude of challenges will make the next few years something exciting to look forward to.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Human languages developed and evolved over thousands of years. Though most languages have a structure (defined by the rules of grammar) we think of spoken languages as a series of informal statements (“informal” compared to the “formal” rigor of mathematical statements). While informal statements helped human species to communicate and collaborate, eventually evolving languages themselves, informal statements were not enough for settling arguments, legal disputes or discovering (new) knowledge from existing knowledge. Socrates, Plato’s teacher, is credited with coming up with inductive arguments and universal definitions. Aristotle’s logic consisted of formulating statements and deriving new knowledge (conclusion) from the knowledge contained in a set of statements (<em>premises</em>) guided by rules that he called <em>syllogisms</em>. Aristotle, a student of Plato, is credited with the earliest study of logic, <em>formal logic</em>, in his collected works <a href="https://archive.org/details/AristotleOrganon/mode/2up"><em>Organon</em></a>. Plato also contributed to the study of reasoning. While Plato relied on <em>deduction</em> from <em>a priori</em> knowledge and postulated that knowledge of things that happen can be deduced from the knowledge of universal ideas, Aristotle’s epistemology postulated that knowledge of things that happen build up to universal knowledge collectively. Together the main recipes for reasoning - induction, deduction and abduction - were discovered that are the pillars for making reasoning infallible.</p>

<p>Mathematicians developed it further for mathematical reasoning which got shaped, like many mathematical computations, into <em>automated reasoning</em> using computer programs by computer scientists. Mathematical logic is the cornerstone of systems that are used for reasoning about the correctness of computer programs.</p>

<p>We can use <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>’s Python API to play with it to see what it means to encode English sentences as logical formulas. Once we are able to encode knowledge (in English sentences) we can use well formed rules of logic to deduce new information, also called <em>logical inference</em>.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This gives the semantics in the form of a logical formula:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>all z2.(dog(z2) -&gt; exists z1.(bone(z1) &amp; give(angus,z1,z2)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Further more, one could use the theorem prover that comes along with NLTK to check for consistency among statements and prove goals (conclusion) given a list of statements (premises). For example, one could write</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">mini_has_ball</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">read_expr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'has(mini)'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">mini2jane</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">read_expr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'pass(mini, jane)'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">rules</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">read_expr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'all x. all y. (pass(x, y) -&gt; has(y))'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We just encoded some English statements as well as the assumption that if <em>x</em> passes the ball to <em>y</em>, then <em>y</em> will have the ball. We can use a theorem prover to prove a goal that <em>jane has the ball</em> and check if it follows from our assumptions, i.e. of the goal can be derived given the assumptions</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">jane_has_ball</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">read_expr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'has(jane)'</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and the prover, if it can establish a proof, will return:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>True
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This kind of encoding and logical reasoning might be needed to answer questions like the last one we saw in a <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2022/03/21/languages-logic-computation">previous post</a>. One might also need more expressive logics in order to encode statements about temporal events succinctly. However, languages themselves are stochastic systems which would imply that we would never be able to come up with logically accurate formulations of the sentences we use in everyday conversations, especially when it involves conversations involving languages that are not one’s native language and might have grammatical mistakes and still convey the intended message. Legal documents or financial documents, for example, could be structured in a precise format that might allow one to formulate the sentences in a logical language and make queries that can return an accurate answer that can be reasoned about if needed - think of a healthcare database to which policy makers submit queries in a natural language. A deep learning based approach, which looks at several usage patterns, to arrive at an approximate formulation which would still enable one to deduce new information from a set of facts already provided. This would be more crucial in developing (explainable) AI systems that can be reasoned about, which is especially crucial in healthcare and other critical domains where AI systems are beginning to find their place.</p>
