          <p>In a <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2021/02/21/us-unemployment">previous post</a>, we saw how many jobs the different states in the U.S. have lost over the years primarily due to trade deficits. In this post, we will visually analyze the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/employment-levels-by-industry.htm">data from BLS</a> and compare the effects of 2008 recession and the ongoing pandemic on the state of employment in the U.S. across different sectors.</p>

<p>The covid-19 pandemic has definitely wrecked the employment across several sectors of the labor economy and not just the hospitality sector. If we look at the employment numbers for an year starting from January 2020, job losses are evident. We also see the quick recovery (though not to January-2020 levels) in several of the sectors.</p>

<p>If we zoom out in the data set and look at two decades of employment numbers all the way from January 2001 until January 2021, we also see the effect of 2008 recession on employment numbers. We also see how gradual and prolonged the effect of 2008 recession was. The job losses across sectors during the pandemic was sudden and steep and the recovery of numbers was also quick.</p>

<p>We can just hope that the recovery from the pandemic continues quicker and reaches early 2020 levels, not only in the U.S. but across the globe. Given that the world is very globalized today than ever before, anyone is healthy and good only when everyone is healthy and good.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>With 2020 being one of the worst in recent history, for many reasons fuelled by the pandemic. With many countries being unprepared to handle a pandemic of this size, it also exposed the global supply chain being <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/04/01/efficiency-vs-flexibility">highly optimized rather than flexible</a>. It also exposed the inequality in society - healthcare, job security, income, etc. Many countries had to start manufacturing personal protective equipments (PPE), ventilators, etc. by themselves to serve the local needs rather than rely on the supply chain that got stalled. A couple of decades ago, many of these equipments were manufactured locally but over time, many of those got offshored.</p>

<p>However, this post is not about unemployment due to the pandemic. It is more about loss of U.S. jobs over the period 2001-2017, mostly due to trade deficits, with data from <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/the-china-toll-deepens-growth-in-the-bilateral-trade-deficit-between-2001-and-2017-cost-3-4-million-u-s-jobs-with-losses-in-every-state-and-congressional-district/">this report</a> and manufacturing data from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/employment-levels-by-industry.htm">BLS data</a>.</p>

<p>The first decade of the century was the worst for U.S. manufacturing jobs. It saw the steepest decline in such jobs, in a very long time. There are two conflicting theories around this - one argues the loss is due to increased automation, while the other attributes the loss to offshoring of such jobs. I could not find the data on rate of automation or increase in manufacturing jobs in other geographies during the time period in order to analyze it analytically. However the loss of jobs, whatever being the root cause, is itself staggering.</p>

<p>Apparently, about four decades ago the Bay Area in California was full of orange orchards, and a couple of decades later they all became startups working in electronics and software (Silicon Valley). They were not startups making apps that let teenagers poke and swipe at each other but advanced electronics and software that goes along with it, like routers, modems, semiconductor chips, etc. There were supposedly many small enterprises manufacturing circuit boards and assembling systems for these famous companies.</p>

</div>

<p>But does it mean only the electronics jobs got offshored? Not really. If we look at the data deeper and look at the number of jobs lost state-wise, it gives a more detailed picture. Almost every major state in the U.S. has lost thousands of jobs from 2001-2017, with most of the loss happening between 2001-2009. Many other states would have seen loss of jobs in other industries like automobiles and steel included.</p>

<p>When I find reliable data on rate of automation and manufacturing jobs gained in other geographies, analysis of that data would help in putting the pieces together. While I am not against offshoring, I am all for a more flexible supply chain, rather than a super-optimized supply chain that would get disrupted affecting the lives and livelihoods of several people, as we witnessed last year when medical devices and PPE supply chain got disrupted.</p>

<p>While many jobs have been offshored causing large scale unemployment, there is still hope for reskilling of workers and creating new jobs that would drive the economy the next two decades - like solar panels, <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/09/13/electric-batteries">electric batteries</a>, recycling of batteries, advanced technologies for water, air purification, education and healthcare, etc.</p>

          <p>Everyone knows GameStop now, and its ticker symbol too - gamers, non-gamers, traders, non-traders, all alike.</p>

<p>GameStop is a chain of retail stores that sells game merchandise, equipment and at one point (when games were sold on CDs) games. Retail is moving online and if the product is software, it has already moved. I canâ€™t recollect the last time I saw Windows OS or Office sold in a CD.</p>

<p>Hedge funds apparently make money by betting on such companies - borrow money or company shares from some lender promising to repay and in the mean time, bet on the downside of the company, wait for the price to crash, buy the stock (for cheap) and give it back to the lender (pocketing the difference). I am not sure how they pick companies to bet on. However, late last year and early January, GameStop was the candidate. In order to revolt againt this, some online enthusiasts mobilized themselves to buy options on this stock, thereby increasing the stock price (â€˜stock priceâ€™ not â€˜company valueâ€™) that would hurt the Hedge fundsâ€™ intentions.</p>

<p>Let us look at some data to see if Hedge funds are the real detterants to GameStopâ€™s future or if there are other factors - like streaming. It was not just GameStop (GME), but also Nokia (NOK), AMC and Blackberry (BB) that went through this early January, but GameStop had the biggest change. Just to show the trend in these stocks (GameStop removed from the plot below as the change in GME was too high that the other trends wouldnâ€™t show up well). Notice how the overall trend in stock prices have been over the last few years and how it changed towards the end of 2020 and early 2021.</p>

<p>In order to see what (game) streaming industry is like, I started looking for data on this - number of subscribers, streamers, etc. I found <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/statistics">Twitchtracker</a> that tracks statistics on Twitch. Since Twitchâ€™s data was easiest to get and well organized, I decided to look at just Twitch data (number of concurrent viewers) and plot it alongside GameStop stock price over the years.</p>

<p>The number of Twitch channels also keep increasing along with the number of viewers and this trend is only likely to continue during these pandemic times.</p>

<p>On the other hand <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188799/gamestop-california-store-closures-indefinite-coronavirus">many retail stores like GameStopâ€™s were hit hard</a> during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Everyone can infer the trend in the industry. Hedge funds are disliked for several reasons, some of them valid. But the future of gaming is online and if GameStop were to survive, it has to build that future than anchor itself in its glorious past.</p>

          <p>A week ago Tesla Motors (TSLA) joined the S&amp;P 500 Index - the stock market index that keeps track of the performance of 500 largest companies listed in stock markets in the US. Overall TSLA has been very volatile - many argue that the volatility (risk) indicates the opportunies for Tesla. Now that we are towards the end of the year, a pandemic year, letâ€™s see how the S&amp;P 500 performed and how Tesla performed.</p>

          <p>We perceive our sense of self as an amalgamation of the different sensory inputs - visual, tactile, locomotive, etc., that our brain processes and interprets. Or in other words, our sense of self is an interpretation made for us by our brain (mind) after processing several inputs. In olden days philosophers who tried to understand oneâ€™s true self found it difficult to reason about the interpretation of sense of self - are we really who we are? or are we manifestations of our mindâ€™s interpretation of several inputs? This is a fascinating topic and lately neuroscience research is trying to understand which parts of the brain are processing and how our brain creates such interpretations.</p>

<p>In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Wasnt-There-Investigations/dp/0525954198">The Man Who Wasnâ€™t There</a>, journalist Anil Ananthaswamy takes us through the neuroscience research on this topic. The main message of this book is that our sense of self is an interpretation of several inputs which are beyond just sensory inputs but our own physical body and society play a vital role. And in this age where Computer Scientists are working on Deep Learning as well as trying to understand the neurological pathways in order to build systems that mimic the human decision making apparatus, while that apparatus itself is not completely understood.</p>

<p>What fascinates me about this study is how the mindâ€™s computation of sense of self can be influenced (or cheated) by changing the mapping (think of it as lookup table entries) the mind preserves for different sensory and other inputs. In many cases, what we feel and believe our sense of self is, is just an interpretation (an entry in the table) that is fetched given the inputs. We can influence such inputs to pick up a different entry that would alter our sense of self. There is also a classic neuroscience experiment from the 90s that demonstrates how the mapping in our brain, representing our physical sense of self, can be altered within minutes. You can take a look at an example experiment below:</p>

<p>I am intrigued about the possibility of changing our emotional sense of self and if it could be done non-invasively using technology. Such a possibility would be a big boost to curing several mental disorders just by altering the mapping in the mind, when we know how the mapping is created, where it is stored and how it is interpreted. Also, one needs to be aware of ramifications of this - can such mappings be altered by say adversarial inputs - visual or societal - in the form of social media posts or news articles. We might be destroying our own sense of self by letting our mind interpret the inputs that we consume, without us realizing the end result - thinking we are who our mind interprets (influenced interpretation/self) rather than who we really are (actual self).</p>
