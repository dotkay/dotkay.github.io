          <p>If you are someone who has been watching Formula One over the last decade, it would be safe to bet that you agree 2021 has been one of the exciting year in the sport. Lots of uncertainity, lots of controversies, new, young and energetic racers, and a super-busy calendar with 22 races. In this post, we will look at the last decade in the sport while doing so using Python and Pandas to analyze, plot and visualize the data.</p>

<p>Mercedes is clearly the front runner, most of it contributed by Lewis Hamilton as we will see very soon. Having lived in Italy and a Ferrari Fan, it is sad to see Ferrari in second place and even more sad to see the downward trend for the prancing horse.</p>

<p>Let’s turn to the drivers who play a key role in making the sport what it is. After Mike Schumacher’s retirement, there was some competition between Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton and to some extent Fernando Alonso and Nico Rosberg. Unfortunately Sebastian Vettel’s dominance faded away and Lewis Hamilton started dominating every race. Very soon there was a new kid in the block - <em>Max Verstappen</em>. Young, energetic and impatient, Max Verstappen, racing for RedBull, quickly started dominating the sport throwing a big challenge to Lewis Hamilton. Many predicted his dominance given the last couple of years and if there was even the slightest of doubts, the 2021 racing season would have cleared those away. Just before the last race, Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen were tied on the same number of points which shows the sheer scale of the competition.</p>

<p>We can also see which countries have scored the most points. Traditionally, Formula One has been more popular in Europe than the rest of the world. There are and were South American champions but not many of them. I believe this might be due to the cost involved in the sport and few can afford it.

<p>In all, 2021 was a fantastic year for Formula One. I wish the most crucial and deciding race had not ended in a controversial way. Sergio Perez played the best team-mate and tons of thanks to Lewis and Max for the entertainment.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Lately, we have been hearing a lot about the <em>metaverse</em>. Although this concept is not new, it has been brought to the limelight because of the huge bets and brand name changes from the potential big players in this space. However, the metaverse that is talked about today is different from what the current state of the internet offers and there are some key technological developments that are drivers of the metaverse and different companies are equipped with different strengths in order to join the competition.</p>

<p>Avatars and game environments have been around for quite some time, especially in immersive video games. The metaverse is much more than avatars or fancy immersive experiences as in video games. It is a platform, rather than a stand-alone application. It is a platform where several applications can be plugged in and get the benefits of the platform. This might be one of the probable reasons a social media messaging company recently rebranded itself. The new brand could mean a platform much bigger than social media, where social media would be just one of the components that could be plugged in. The metaverse combines AR (Augmented Reality) with communication and collaboration tools and in some cases with the help of VR (Virtual Reality) that results in an immersive, photorealistic communication, collaboration and entertainment experience. Many technological developments that happened over the course of the last decade are key to the big bets on the possibilities of metaverse.</p>

<p>The main technological advancements could be grouped under the following categories.</p>

<p><strong>Graphics Hardware (Semiconductors)</strong>
Computer processors have not just packed more and more transistors but the capabilities of graphics hardware have grown by leaps and bounds the last decade. The semiconductor process technology, new memory technologies, new functions and features driven by deep learning applications, real-time ray tracing, etc. have enabled a new era of computation possibilities at scale that until recently required expensive servers running over long periods of time in order to achieve the same computation. A big part of this is driven by semiconductor process technology (32nm in 2009 to 5nm in 2020) that enabled packing several transistors in a small area (of the die). Similar advances in memory technologies (3D stacked DRAM, advances in DDR as well as HBM and other new memory technologies) helped in increasing the on board storage by a large factor, as required by heavy graphics applications. Similar advances have also resulted in packing enough computation in small form factors like mobile phones, security cameras and other IoT devices. It has resulted in our ability to play games with a reasonably good graphics on our mobile phones. It has also enabled IoT devices to perform data analytics real time as and when they collect sensory data on the field.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Graphics Software (VR, AR, Photogrammetry, etc.)</strong></p>

<p>If hardware was all that was needed, it would have been a commodity. The software layer brings in the innovation that software companies constantly compete to better each other at. For example, irrespective of intel or M1 processor the software layer should ensure that the applications work seamlessly across hardware configurations and operating systems. The more tied the hardware is to the software layer, more performance can be squeezed out of the hardware. Many of the graphics applications need a tremendous amount of compute power. This is especially true for photorealistic graphics. Even given the advances in semiconductors, especially graphics processing units, graphics software innovations require a mix of technology, science and art. While most software companies excel at technology, few excel in combining the three. Graphics components are relatively easy to create, but rendering photo-realistic graphics in real time in different form factors is not straight forward. Advances in AI techniques like Deep Learning Super Sampling (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/dlss">DLSS</a>) and post-processing techniques like Temporal Anti-Aliasing (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/es-la/drivers/txaa-anti-aliasing-technology/">TAA</a>) techniques have helped tremendously. Techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry">photogrammetry</a> play a vital role in creating digital twins of artifacts, besides 3D cameras and effective and scalable stitching algorithms. AR also involves merging the physical world (camera sensed) augmented with layers of graphics content. Since motion of objects is the undoubted constant in all VR and AR experiences (as anyone who has watched YouTube 360 videos or played with an Oculus headset can attest), simulating physics is the next challenge to overcome. Simulating physics, beyond fire, waves and wind in Computer Graphics is a non-trivial task that requires <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8yzFfSrDAg">simulating different materials</a> like stones, marbles, snow, etc., besides their interactions with light rays (reflection, refraction, etc.) and rendering caustics. Although today’s graphics is a major leap from a decade ago, metaverse would demand a much higher quality of photorealistic real-time graphics.</p>

<p><strong>Internet, 5G and streaming games</strong></p>

<p>Metaverse has the potential to change collaboration and media consumption in ways internet changed marketing and commerce. The advances in the same technologies (web2.0, fiber optics, mobile internet, 3G, 4G) that propelled internet adoption would also catalyze technologies like metaverse. Over the last few decades, internet has completely transformed how we consume media content (streaming media, social media, etc. compared to print and television) and how we collaborate (Webex, Zoom, Google Docs, etc. compared to telephone calls and fax messages) increasing both efficiency and effectiveness. The internet infrastructure already being able to stream online games and movies and constantly improving bandwidth and connectivity, companies can safely bet on further improvements that would support applications in the metaverse. New and upcoming technologies like 5G would bring bandwidth intensive applications like gaming within reach for mobile consumers. As adoption increases there would be new opportunities for businesses with new and innovative business models emerging out of it, much in the same way internet created a wide array of marketplace business models (Amazon, Uber, Doordash, etc.). Many doubted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GltlJO56S1g">Amazon’s</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gipL_CEw-fk">Microsoft’s</a> potential at the beginning of the internet era. The companies that do not see the potential of the metaverse might get left behind when the potentials are realized by the leaders.</p>

<p><strong>Social Networks</strong></p>

<p>The current decade has seen an interesting growth in content creation. The growth of social media enabled everyone to interact and showcase their talent. Specifically, apps like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok made it possible for independent content creators and small businesses to reach and market their products and services effectively in a cost-efficient manner. Gaming is inherently a social activity. The more immersive or innovative games are, the more attention they get (e.g. <a href="https://www.inc.com/josh-linkner/the-disruptive-innovation-behind-pok-mon-go.html">Pokemon Go</a>). When we think about it, there are many activities like movies, theatre, live sports, education, etc. that are also social activities, or at least the experience is enriched a lot when done as a social activity. Metaverse could offer these activities in the virtual world - for example, right from your living room in Singapore, you could watch US open, sitting in front-row seats at Arthur Ashe stadium, wearing your VR headset sitting next your close friend who is wearing another VR headset and is sitting in his living room in Sydney. Though we might be inclined to think that popular social media players would have an advantage in metaverse, we could also see new innovative players who could change the game. The bottom line is that for many of these social activities, metaverse would offer a much richer experience than what the current internet offers.</p>

<p>There are many other drivers that might directly or indirectly influence the adoption like enterprise communication and collaboration applications like WebEx or Zoom extended to factory floors rather than just computer screens, virtual tourism and adventure trips, etc. It is difficult to predict if metaverse would succeed but it is definitely going to bring lots of innovations in immersive graphics, simulation as well as hardware architectures.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>In this post, we will see the most ubiquitous, most useful and also the most easily mis-interpreted data visualization tools - <em>charts</em>. They come in various forms and they are used to represent different aspects of the underlying data. The key assumption is that the visual representation is easier to interpret quickly than in a tabular format. More often, one kind of story a chart conveys might hide another kind of story a different chart, of the underlying dataset, might have conveyed. It is not uncommon to find that the reader would interpret the chart in a way different from what the writer wanted to convey, in which case it is best for the writer to clarify the message being driven.</p>

<p>For example, let us look at the latest global vaccination data. When you look at the per-capita vaccination rates of different countries, and say you pick the top 50 countries, you would see a chart similar to the following (the chart below is from September, 2021). More specifically, the chart shows the number of fully vaccinated people per hundred of the population.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">

</div>

<p>What story does this tell? While per-capita numbers are a way to normalize the data, it crucially depends on the story that one wants to tell. Does this indicate the ease of availability of vaccines? Does it indicate the effectiveness of the healthcare system? Does this indicate the willingness of people to get the vaccine? Or something else?</p>

<p>Let us look at the absolute numbers for the same data and look at the chart.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">
  <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/data_science/master/plots/people_vax.png" /></center>
</div>

<p><span style="color:gray; font-size: 50%; text-align: left;">
Data regarding fully vaccinated population from China was missing from the dataset and hence it does not show up in the chart. China had the most fully vaccinated population (absolute numbers) in September, 2021.
</span></p>

<p>We see a different picture. What story does this tell?</p>

<p>While both of the above charts convey useful information, it is necessary to understand what useful story could be told using the above. For example, the first chart (per-capita) could indicate what percentage of the total population is vaccinated. This could indicate to what extent the spread of the virus or hospitalizations could be contained and that very likely these countries could get out of the pandemic sooner and become safer to travel to. It does not indicate the effectiveness of the healthcare system or the challenges in getting more people vaccinated, etc.</p>

<p>The second chart shows the absolute number of people vaccinated in many countries. The difference between the two charts could show the challenges in getting the population vaccinated - it could be geographical as in some countries might be too large posing a logistics challenge, it could be the size of the population - even if enough vaccines are in supply more would be needed to get the entire population vaccinated or it could be a short supply of vaccines - again because of lack of storage or the price or a weak healthcare infrastructure.</p>

<p>On similar lines, when you look at GDP data and plot the top 50 countries by GDP the chart looks something like the following.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">
  <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/data_science/master/plots/gdp_2018_top_50.png" /></center>
</div>
<p><span style="color:gray; font-size: 50%; text-align: left;">
The GDP numbers are from 2018 rather than latest numbers in order to avoid the variations of the effects of the pandemic on GDP.
</span></p>

<p>It shows the wealthiest countries (in terms of GDP). But does the wealth trickle down to every individual? Again, there might be challenges like population, management of funds, etc. Once you look at per-capita numbers one could see how different countries fare.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">
  <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/data_science/master/plots/gdp_per_capita_2018_top_50.png" /></center>
</div>

<p>When you look at the GDP growth rate, it tells a different story - the countries that are improving from their past year. Yes, Libya did have 15% GDP growth in 2018.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">
  <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/data_science/master/plots/gdp_growth_rate_2018.png" /></center>
</div>

<p>The chart we choose should depend on the story we want to tell. It is imperative to explicitly explain the choice of chart and how it tells the story the writer wants to tell and also the stories it does not.</p>

          <p>This is about the stories of Summer Olympics - not just one story but many stories and not just the recently concluded Tokyo Olympics, but all of the Olympic games since the first one in Athens in 1896. Although the analysis of the medals won by different countries would make the story read like a story medals and achievements statistics, there are other stories hidden within. We will narrate many of those as we do the analysis.</p>

<p>We will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pandas</code> library to do the data analysis and plotly to create our plots that would tell a visual story.</p>

<p>When we look at the hosts we see many western powers with Brazil and China (then emerging economies) hosting in 2008 and 2016 respectively. Of course, hosting an Olympics is no small thing - the infrastructure, safety, accessibility, etc. play a huge role and many of these cost money. London seems to be the only city that has hosted Olympics thrice.</p>

<p>The number of events in each of the Olympics also seems to be different, as evidenced by the total number of medals awarded during the games. With Paris and London regularly competing for the best European City regularly I believe it is high time Paris got a chance to host the Summer Olympic games, and very glad 2024 Olympics are going to be held in Paris. I also hope more and more emerging economies to be able to host the games. The motivation and interest in sports such events would infuse is invaluable.</p>

<p>When we look at the cumulative number of medals won from the start of Summer Olympic games, USA clearly leads. But more important to note here is Russia which was more excellent in sports, science and technology, arts and culture, etc., when it was Soviet Union. Also interesting to note is the presence of an entry <em>Individual athletes</em> - athletes who chose to compete under the Olympic flag instead of any specific country. This is a political story.</p>

<p>There were many instances where athletes who requested to compete independently and were refused - for example, the ones who emigrated from Communist Europe during the cold war, as well as some during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Olympic_boycott">1976 Olympic boycott</a>. The first provisions were made by IOC (International Olympic Committee) during the 1980 Summer Olympics hosted at Moscow.</p>

<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" align="middle" src="https://plotly.com/~kkplot/15.embed" height="600" width="1000"></iframe>

<p>When we look at the countries that shine on the top of the medals table regularly the familiar pattern is clear. It is mostly European countries, USA, Australia and more recently China. Although we might have cheered Usain Bolt’s sprints and track and field athletics being one of the most anticipated events of the Summer Olympic games, in terms of total number of medals, many western countries top the table year after year. This also indicates the broad variety and the number of events in the summer games.</p>

<p>There is also a political story hidden here, that of the 1980 Summer Olympics. There were only two cities that bid to host the games - Los Angeles and Moscow and eventually Moscow won. If you notice the 1980 Olympics that was hosted by Moscow, Russia seems to be the clear leader in terms of number of medals. Almost always, one expects host country to win several medals, but scoring more medals than the usual competitive powers is always a big achievement. Many nations boycotted the 1980 Olympics, led by the USA to protest against the Soviet-Afghan war. It had the smallest participation - just around 80 countries.</p>

<p>There are more politics stories in Olympics. The apparent gaps in the plot below makes one wonder what happened those years. The 1916 summer Olympics, to be hosted by Berlin, were cancelled due to World War I, a first cancellation in the 20 year history of Olympics during those days. The 1940 Olympics to be hosted by Tokyo were rescheduled to be hosted by Finland (due to Japan’s invasion of China in 1937) and eventually cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II. Again, the 1944 Summer Olympics to be hosted by London got cancelled due to World War II. The 2020 Olympics hosted by Tokyo was rescheduled to 2021 due to the outbreak of Covid. It took tremendous courage and organization by Japan and the participating countries to put up a great show during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Now, to finish it off, let us see how the top 25 medal winners (measured as per medals won in 2020)
have fared over the years in terms of total medals won. The rise of China as a major sporting nation is very apparent.</p>

<p>While this short post tells several stories behind the Summer Olympics, I would like to write a future post on the stories behind Paralympics which will would be stories of courge, inspiration and extraordinary commitment.</p>

          <p>Automakers are in the news lately, not for the the usual reasons like launching fully electric models of their vehicles, or factory closures or emission scandals. They are in the news because of semiconductor shortage, throwing many into a state of shock. For people following the auto industry this is only as common as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/chip-maker-for-apple-qualcomm-amd-warns-chip-shortage-to-last-through-2022">Apple, Qualcomm or AMD’s woes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The rise of the ECUs</strong>
For more than a decade now, there has been more and more software and silicon that go into automobiles than steel. A typical automobile has about a couple of hundred Electronic Control Units (ECUs) which are microcontrollers each receiving inputs from different (like tire pressure, oil, seat belt, engine temperature, etc.) and producing outputs that translate to action (like a dashboard indicator light on low tire pressure, etc.). Since the cost of sensors have been going down rapidly, more and more of them are added in today’s vehicles and hence more ECUs to process them. The software that goes along is also tightly coupled with the hardware and these ECUs are bought from different OEMs. Much like a computer architecture, most of the automakers connect these ECUs through a common bus usually over a Controller Area Network <a href="https://www.engineersgarage.com/can-protocol-understanding-the-controller-area-network-protocol/">(CAN)</a>. The number of ECUs have only been increasing with the number of features. Rain sensors, daylight sensors, blind-spot sensors, parking sensors are all commonplace in today’s vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>From ECUs to DCUs</strong>
ECUs constitute a <em>decentralized</em> architecture - each ECU controls a particular function. With the increasing number of ECUs controlling critical functions like ADAS (Advanced Driver Assist Systems), autonomous driving, radars, etc., the industry has been moving to an architecture called DCU (Domain Control Unit) wherein instead of hundreds of ECUs a few DCUs would control multiple functions. This has been enabled by advances in semiconductors (performance and power) over the years and the decreasing cost of sensors. In a sense, DCUs constitute a <em>centralized</em> architecture. Much like how a PC Operating System can make way for high priority tasks, the software enabling the DCUs could prioritize critical functions. Further, this also enables flexibility and extensibility. The hardware (sensors and processing power) would remain in the vehicle and new software when installed would provide a new feature, much like how you have a CPU and memory (hardware) in your laptop and you can install Microsoft Office (software) if and when needed. From CAN, the automobiles are trying to move on to ethernet based architecture for many of the functionalities because of the faster transmission speed and more data per frame. CAN provides predictable and collision-free network access between nodes.</p>

<p><strong>Into the Future</strong>
With advanced sensors (like cameras and lidar) providing streaming, high resolution data, the processing power of the hardware needs to be beefed up in order to process them in real-time. This has enabled the makers of high performance processors to enter the market to compete with the many ECU vendors. NVIDIA and Intel are two of the major processor makers that are making their presence felt in the automotive space, besides Qualcomm and others. With hardware being the muscle, more and more value would be added by innovation in software (the mind). For example, a camera might just send frames of a snowy scene which software could then process, along with some real-time data it receives from neibouring vehicles or cellular phone towers, etc. and create an actionable insight for the actuators. Software can use the historical data from the vehicle for diagnosis and more importantly prognosis of faults. With the decreasing cost of sensors the data collected will explode in volume over time and the automotive software stack might also include a cloud component to store data for continuous processing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the importance of electronics and software has grown, so has complexity. Take the exploding number of software lines of code (SLOC) contained in modern cars as an example. In 2010, some vehicles had about ten million SLOC; by 2016, this expanded by a factor of 15, to roughly 150 million lines. Snowballing complexity is causing significant software-related quality issues, as evidenced by millions of recent vehicle recalls - <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/rethinking-car-software-and-electronics-architecture">McKinsey &amp; Co.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With most vehicles made of steel and aluminium the value differentiator was brought about by the (electronic) features over the past decade. The next decade would usher in a new era of value differentiation enabled by software innovations. Who would own the hardware and operating system (much like Windows and Intel or Android and ARM in PC and mobile generation) of the era of automobile innovation is yet to be seen.</p>
