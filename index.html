          <p>Everyone knows GameStop now, and its ticker symbol too - gamers, non-gamers, traders, non-traders, all alike.</p>

<p>GameStop is a chain of retail stores that sells game merchandise, equipment and at one point (when games were sold on CDs) games. Retail is moving online and if the product is software, it has already moved. I can’t recollect the last time I saw Windows OS or Office sold in a CD.</p>

<p>Hedge funds apparently make money by betting on such companies - borrow money or company shares from some lender promising to repay and in the mean time, bet on the downside of the company, wait for the price to crash, buy the stock (for cheap) and give it back to the lender (pocketing the difference). I am not sure how they pick companies to bet on. However, late last year and early January, GameStop was the candidate. In order to revolt againt this, some online enthusiasts mobilized themselves to buy options on this stock, thereby increasing the stock price (‘stock price’ not ‘company value’) that would hurt the Hedge funds’ intentions.</p>

<p>Let us look at some data to see if Hedge funds are the real detterants to GameStop’s future or if there are other factors - like streaming. It was not just GameStop (GME), but also Nokia (NOK), AMC and Blackberry (BB) that went through this early January, but GameStop had the biggest change. Just to show the trend in these stocks (GameStop removed from the plot below as the change in GME was too high that the other trends wouldn’t show up well). Notice how the overall trend in stock prices have been over the last few years and how it changed towards the end of 2020 and early 2021.</p>

<p>In order to see what (game) streaming industry is like, I started looking for data on this - number of subscribers, streamers, etc. I found <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/statistics">Twitchtracker</a> that tracks statistics on Twitch. Since Twitch’s data was easiest to get and well organized, I decided to look at just Twitch data (number of concurrent viewers) and plot it alongside GameStop stock price over the years.</p>

<p>The number of Twitch channels also keep increasing along with the number of viewers and this trend is only likely to continue during these pandemic times.</p>

<p>On the other hand <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188799/gamestop-california-store-closures-indefinite-coronavirus">many retail stores like GameStop’s were hit hard</a> during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Everyone can infer the trend in the industry. Hedge funds are disliked for several reasons, some of them valid. But the future of gaming is online and if GameStop were to survive, it has to build that future than anchor itself in its glorious past.</p>

          <p>A week ago Tesla Motors (TSLA) joined the S&amp;P 500 Index - the stock market index that keeps track of the performance of 500 largest companies listed in stock markets in the US. Overall TSLA has been very volatile - many argue that the volatility (risk) indicates the opportunies for Tesla. Now that we are towards the end of the year, a pandemic year, let’s see how the S&amp;P 500 performed and how Tesla performed.</p>

<p>And in terms of the value of TSLA stock and S&amp;P 500 Index, this is how they fared during this year:</p>

          <p>We perceive our sense of self as an amalgamation of the different sensory inputs - visual, tactile, locomotive, etc., that our brain processes and interprets. Or in other words, our sense of self is an interpretation made for us by our brain (mind) after processing several inputs. In olden days philosophers who tried to understand one’s true self found it difficult to reason about the interpretation of sense of self - are we really who we are? or are we manifestations of our mind’s interpretation of several inputs? This is a fascinating topic and lately neuroscience research is trying to understand which parts of the brain are processing and how our brain creates such interpretations.</p>

<p>In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Wasnt-There-Investigations/dp/0525954198">The Man Who Wasn’t There</a>, journalist Anil Ananthaswamy takes us through the neuroscience research on this topic. The main message of this book is that our sense of self is an interpretation of several inputs which are beyond just sensory inputs but our own physical body and society play a vital role. And in this age where Computer Scientists are working on Deep Learning as well as trying to understand the neurological pathways in order to build systems that mimic the human decision making apparatus, while that apparatus itself is not completely understood.</p>

<p>What fascinates me about this study is how the mind’s computation of sense of self can be influenced (or cheated) by changing the mapping (think of it as lookup table entries) the mind preserves for different sensory and other inputs. In many cases, what we feel and believe our sense of self is, is just an interpretation (an entry in the table) that is fetched given the inputs. We can influence such inputs to pick up a different entry that would alter our sense of self. There is also a classic neuroscience experiment from the 90s that demonstrates how the mapping in our brain, representing our physical sense of self, can be altered within minutes. You can take a look at an example experiment below:</p>

<p>I am intrigued about the possibility of changing our emotional sense of self and if it could be done non-invasively using technology. Such a possibility would be a big boost to curing several mental disorders just by altering the mapping in the mind, when we know how the mapping is created, where it is stored and how it is interpreted. Also, one needs to be aware of ramifications of this - can such mappings be altered by say adversarial inputs - visual or societal - in the form of social media posts or news articles. We might be destroying our own sense of self by letting our mind interpret the inputs that we consume, without us realizing the end result - thinking we are who our mind interprets (influenced interpretation/self) rather than who we really are (actual self).</p>

          <p>In an <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/06/01/covid-vs-coal/">earlier post</a>, we learnt something that we do not see everyday, even if we work in a coal mine, as the variety of energy and the consumption end points blind us from looking at the full picture. Today, we will look at some trends that we see all around us, all the time - Electric vehicles (EVs).</p>

<p>For most of us, an <em>electric car</em> immediately reminds us of Tesla - the innovative American automobile manufacturer that is to become the world’s most valuable automobile company very soon. Tesla is also the company that created an electric car revolution. Tesla’s success, in many ways, drove other automakers to accelerate their offering of all-electric products. We saw that the transition was not overnight. Many built hybrid vehicles (HEV), range-extended electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV), before building all electric, or battery electric vehicles (BEV). However, if one is to guess which country on the planet has the most number of electric cars it would most likely be the US or EU, because of Tesla and the likes of VW or BMW (both of which make electric cars). Let’s see how the actual answer unfolds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">IEA’s global outlook</a> and data show some impressive numbers. To quote from their report,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only about 17 000 electric cars were on the world’s roads in 2010. By 2019, that number had swelled to 7.2 million, 47% of which were in The People’s Republic of China.</p>
</blockquote>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/energy/evs.PNG" alt="EVs in the world" class="img=responsive" /></p>
</div>

<p>Further, despite purchase subsidies for electric cars were cut in many geographies (like tax credits in the US) and the resulting drop in electric car sales, the total number electric vehicles in China, EU and the US are still very impressive - 2.58 million BEVs in China compared to 0.88 million BEVs in the US and 0.97 million BEVs in the EU.</p>

<p>One would start thinking what other industries are getting transformed along with the transformation of automotive industry. The implications of this transformation are huge touching several industries from service industry, retail and insurance. The analysis of the transformation itself would give fascninating insights. That would be the topic of a future post.</p>

          <p>I was listening to an interesting news program on renewable energy recently that made claims and projections about the current state and future of energy - primarily about renewable energy overtaking coal as the major source of energy. As a result of Covid, demand for electricity has fallen and as coal has become more and more expensive than renewable counterparts, coal based electricity is facing an uphill battle. Will coal survive the covid crisis, in developed countries, is yet to be seen.</p>

<p>This prompted me to dig further into the data on energy production and consumption in the US. I was indeed surprised to see that coal based energy production is in fact decreasing in the US, and is decreasing drastically. I was surpised by two factors. First, I thought only under-developed or developing countries were the places where coal based energy was a major source, primarily due to the lack of infrastructure (like efficient transmission grids) and the cost of renewable energy (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.). Second, nuclear power production has flattened out somewhere in the last decade, and is now overtaken by renewable energy. With several nuclear power plants built over the decades, some of them dangerously <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42103936/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/what-are-odds-us-nuke-plants-ranked-quake-risk/">close to fault lines</a>, I was expecting more energy to be generated by nuclear plants. It turned out that was not the case.</p>

<p>Looking at the data, coal production is indeed decreasing and at such a rate that it is almost close to what it was in the 1950s. While renewable energy is all set to overtake coal based energy and experts predict 2020 to be the year for this to happen. In fact, renewable energy production has already overtaken nuclear energy.</p>

<p>While the above is certainly positive news, there are several other fossil fuels (natural gas, crude oil, etc.) just like there are several renewable energy sources (hydroelectric,  solar, wind, etc.). Looking at more details at the different sources of fossil fuels, although coal production has reduced, total fossil fuel production is still way more than renewable energy production as the following chart shows.</p>
