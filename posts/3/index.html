        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Happy New year friends!</p>

<p>What a year 2018 has been for the topic of privacy and security - from the most loved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html">social network</a> scrambling for clues to save themselves to the other <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/10/google-to-shut-down-early-after-privacy-flaw-affects-over-50m-users">social network</a> built by the world’s best engineers still couldn’t save their data, besides struggling to stay relevant. While Europe was quick to pass <a href="https://eugdpr.org/">GDPR</a>, many other countries even in the developed world are yet to catch up with such laws and regulations. 2018 was also the year that saw the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/28/smart-speakers-hit-critical-mass-in-2018/">surge in smart speakers</a> and home automation - isn’t that ironic?</p>

<p>But this story is not about the past, but about the future. Many top technology and auto companies rushing to fulfill the promise of self-driving or autonomous vehicles. It will definitely become a reality, to some extent, in at least the parts of the world where the infrastructure supports it. But the notion of foolproof security for such a technology is far from being achieved. With smartphone apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Google+ security issues, we have only scratched the surface of the malevolent intent that is possible. Once autonomous vehicles and other IoT devices reach critical mass, the security issues are only going to multiply manifold and the impact of security flaws can have disastrous consequences. Imagine a malicious attacker taking control of traffic lights that talk to cars or cars talking to other cars to negotiate who gets to cross an intersection, or a mass rapid transit system that reroutes itself or changes frequency of rides depending on real-time ridership information using neural network based predictions. Imagine the impact of such a thing gone wrong. With the current day deep learning algorithms themselves not being tractable (i.e. one can not reliably track the computation from input data to the prediction step by step as in <a href="https://skymind.ai/wiki/symbolic-reasoning">symbolic AI</a>) it is going to be more challenging to resolve a security issue even after having identified it. Apologies for being pessimistic - but one should see this as a challenge for computer architecture and computer security research - a great time to be working in any of these fields.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want a job for the next one year, learn web/mobile app development, if you need a job for the next five years, train yourself with deep learning skills, if you need a job for the rest of your life, start working on computer security.</p>

          <p>Keeping up with my modest goals from the <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2018/08/15/deep-learning-and-tech-products">previous post</a>, I started looking at Google’s product portfolio.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why Google? - Why not?</li>
  <li>Why their product portfolio? - there is such a rich variety catering to different customer segments.</li>
  <li>Why for this topic (analysing how machine learning and/or deep learning will impact/improve the products)? - Because we already see the impact (like Google translate, maps, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s their product portfolio, right from their webpage:</p>

          <p>I happened to complete an online course on Deep Learning and just starting to look at different products to see how machine learning or deep learning techniques could be used to make these products better. Since I understand technology products and their landscape better, I am likely to be biased in analysing more technology products than non-tech ones, although I am determined to study some non-tech industries, processes, products and services to see if (at all) and how deep learning could be used there - that is a bigger challenge and one that would stimulate our neurons more. Let’s see how I fare …</p>

          <p>While driving back from a camping along with my friends and looking at the vast possibly burnt areas, we started thinking why even in the <em>so called</em> hot bed of technology (Silicon Valley) we <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/30/why-planes-cant-fight-shastas-deadly-carr-fire/">hear</a> that fire fighting aircrafts had visibility problems because of the dense smoke. Why can’t we use autonomous drone technology for fighting wild fires (given that we use unmanned drones for warfare). Something to think about seriously.</p>

          <p>Allez les Bleus!!</p>

<p>Just happened to listen to this week’s episode of one of the recent NPR podcast series titled <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain">Hidden Brain</a> and it got me thinking a lot. I speak almost 5 languages (not fluently but to different degrees of expertise) and I am not sure how my mind thinks. One thing for sure though is that I happen to think in my mother tongue and my mind translates it in (almost) real-time while I communicate, be it talking or writing down my thoughts as I do while writing this blog post. If languages do influence our thinking and understanding and more importantly the biases we cultivate, what does it mean for language translators - do they also convey the biases that are inherently influenced by one’s language? Or as a technologist I am also inclined to think what would it mean for AI systems (say chat-bots) that are meant to facilitate communication? I now tend to believe that they have to be designed with the intricacies of languages and the influences, biases that it carries along encoded into the system in order for it to be more acceptable. Even if not as a chat-bot, it would be a great system to train people to work with people of different cultures so that we understand different cultures better and comfortably communicate taking into account their nuances.</p>
