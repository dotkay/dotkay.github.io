          <p>In a <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/03/01/market-returns-and-stocks">previous post</a> we saw how volatile a stock is, compared to a broader market performance, by plotting the percentage change in weekly returns of the stock prices. We were able to visually see that a certain stock was moving much more vigorously than the market (S&amp;P 500 in that case).</p>

<p>In this post, I want to see how to find and measure the movement of a particular stock with respect to the market. Is there a standardized measure? Suppose an investor who holds multiple assets wants to measure how much risk <em>a</em> particular asset adds to his portfolio, is there a way he can quantify the risk?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Statistically, <em>covariance</em> of an asset measures how much the asset moves compared to market movements</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Beta</em> is a standardized measure of this covariance.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        covariance of asset with market 
Beta =  ---------------------------------
            variance of the market
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we have market returns data that we used in our previous plot, we can run a regression on this data and try to fit a straight line to the data points in our dataset. The slope of the regression is the <em>Beta</em>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>R_asset = alpha + beta * R_market
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let us use the <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org">statsmodels</a> library to compute a linear regression.</p>

<p>Since we used (percentage change in ) <em>adjusted closing prices</em> in our returns (with the column name ‘Adj Close’ in our dataframe), we see that the <em>beta</em> of NVIDIA stock during the period of the regression (2015-2019) is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.79</code>. We also see the R-squared value of our regression which turns out to be 0.265 and this indicates that 26.5% of the risk can be attributed to the market risk while the remaining <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">73.5%</code> of the risk is firm specific. We also see the P value of our regression and a bunch of other details.</p>

<p>We can also plot our regression:</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I recently started learning about stock prices, market returns and how risk is measured. I am still in the process of learning about it and I hope to add more to my knowledge in the following months.</p>

<p>There are many stock indices to look for how the general market is performing. More often, we hear about DOW index (DJIA - Dow Jones Industrial Average) down or NASDAQ up and so on. But NASDAQ is a technology firm heavy listing - i.e. the movement of the NASDAQ index would indicate the movement of technology sector to a large extent. While DJIA is a more general mix of stocks, it is price weighted and so companies with a higher stock price or extreme price movements would influence the movement more. Another common index is the S&amp;P 500 (Standard and Poor’s 500) Index. S&amp;P 500 is weighted by market value of the companies rather than the stock prices. So, a 5% movement of a $200 stock would affect the index the same way as a 5% movement of a $100 stock.</p>

<p>Let us see how the weekly percentage change in returns of one of the stocks (NVDA) compares to the percentage returns of the S&amp;P 500 returns (usually referred to as <em>market returns</em>), over a period of about five years.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">...</span>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">

</div>

<p>The above plot shows you how much NVDA (NVIDIA stock prices) fluctuate more than the general market (S&amp;P 500 price index). If the stock is too volatile, it might be because of some risk associated with that stock, some portion of which can be explained by market movements and some portion specific to the company’s internal risk. <em>Beta</em> is typically used as a measure of risk, which we will compute in a future post.</p>

          <p>Lately, I have been reading about several businesses and trying to understand their product offerings, value proposition of the products, business model and how they came to be. With a natural inclination for technology products and a curiosity about startups and business models, this has been an enjoyable learning experience and I am hoping to share a lot of my learning through this medium. Let’s start with LinkedIn.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Vision</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.</p>
</blockquote>

<dl>
  <dt>I liked the simple and clear vision statement but was wondering why it mentions only <em>economic opportunity</em> while LinkedIn’s products offer much more or could it be the case that all the benefits the products offer can be tied to economic opportunity? I started researching about what this term <em>economic opportunity</em> entails and found <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-are-economic-opportunities-defined">this answer</a> in Quora:</dt>
  <dt><br /></dt>

    <p><em>When somebody is willing to pay you money for doing something that you are willing and able to do, that is an “economic opportunity”. It can be a small business idea or a job.If you can produce a product or provide a service that people are willing to pay for, that is a small business opportunity. If you have an ability or skill that an employer needs, that is a job opportunity.</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p><em>Basically, an economic opportunity is the chance to do work that somebody is willing to pay you for. You don’t have to “like” the work. You just have to be able to competently do it. If you like your work, all the better for you. But we work to earn money that is paid by other people. The work we do is for other people’s benefit. The money they pay us is for our benefit. It is a reciprocal pay-earn, demand-supply economic relationship. They pay us money for supplying them what they want.</em></p>

<p>I, however, feel that LinkedIn also provides knowledge opportunity (learning), business/marketing opportunity (sales leads) and career opportunity (jobs for professionals) and talent development (hiring solutions for recruiters) opportunity, etc. There might be some or some aspects of these on which you cannot really put a dollar value on in order for them to be called an <em>economic opportunity</em>.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Mission</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mission of LinkedIn is simple: connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, a short and crisp mission statement. But, again I believe that the main benefit is making professionals more skilled, equipped, informed, etc., rather than just productive.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Products</strong></p>

<p>LinkedIn to many is just a networking site for professionals. But once you look at the suite of products it is much more than that. LinkedIn’s products are organized under four themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hire</li>
  <li>Market</li>
  <li>Sell</li>
  <li>Learn</li>
</ul>

<p>The various products under each of these themes are shown below:</p>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_products.jpg" alt="LinkedIn's Products" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p>It is difficult to categorize each of the products into <em>advertisement-based</em> or <em>subscription-based</em> one as some of them overlap both business models. The <em>HIRE</em> theme is mainly for human resources professionals to track, follow, and manage recruiting pipeline for their organizations. I believe this could be one of the most active products (along with learning) on the platform. The <em>MARKET</em> theme helps in setting up marketing campaigns, reach out to potential resources for marketing purposes, set up custom pages, and serve advertisements on the pages and possibly through emails. Although it sounds like a lot of features, I believe they would have a very stiff competition from the likes of Google and Facebook. Although the advertisements would be more relevant to hiring and professional marketing, the eyeballs on these wouldn’t be as much as on Google search and Facebook feeds. However, with the volume of professionals in the network, hiring ads would get the best reach on this platform. The <em>SELL</em> theme sounds like a specialized Salesforce platform.  The <em>LEARN</em> theme is an upcoming Coursera. Although it may not offer a wide variety of specializations for now, with data from the <em>HIRE</em> theme, it would be a more powerful medium for specialized skill development targeted at specific job roles in specific industries. We need to wait and watch how well Microsoft uses the data from one to better the offerings of another. Although LinkedIn membership is free, there is also a premium subscription which could be considered as a separate product in itself (creating significant revenue) and it is needed to use several of the other products, for example InMail.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s business</strong></p>

<dl>
  <dt>LinkedIn has become a significant business unit of Microsoft. According to a <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/">source</a></dt>
  <dt><br /></dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>In the 2019 fiscal year, LinkedIn brought in $6.8 billion worth of revenue, contributing to $38.1 billion of commercial cloud revenue for Microsoft, which in turn made up part of $126 billion total revenue.</em></p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Further the numbers below from Microsoft’s earnings and LinkedIn newsroom validate the importance of LinkedIn and its potential.</p>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_fy20_q1.PNG" alt="LinkedIn FY20 Q1" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_stats.PNG" alt="LinkedIn impact" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Opportunity</strong></p>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_worldwide.png" alt="LinkedIn Stats" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p>And that shows the opportunity for LinkedIn. Along with the above, GitHub - the world’s largest software development platform or the playground for developers was snapped up by Microsoft. This indicates a very huge potential. The data from <em>HIRE</em> theme above combined with <em>LEARN</em> theme and fueled by GitHub platform is a wonderful growth opportunity. GitHub + LinkedIn for developers would be Instagram for fashionistas and for businesses and recruiters this would be the Instagram for fashion brands seeking ambassadors and influencers. Probably some day very soon let me write about the opportunity for data science and AI in stitching all the above products together as one awesome fabric.</p>

<p>Thats all for now!</p>

          <p>As people who know me understand, I read articles and listen to podcasts on a variety of topics ranging from technology, social science, society, economics, etc. Economics is one of my favourites, as it is very relatable to our day to day lives, besides involving mathematical modelling (which, for the same reasons as Deep Learning techniques of today, can only be close to a very good approximation but never accurate). While listening to BBC’s Business Daily podcasts, I stumbled upon this episode on Modern Monetary Theory. The title of the podcast - “Magic Money Tree” caught my attention and it turned out to be an interesting take on a proposal by one of the former Hedge Fund manager about central banks being able to print more money when needed. I did have this idea when I was a kid before I realized inflation and value of goods and how they are tied to abundance of ciculation of money, interest rates and consumer spending. I am not an economist but I am worried how this could lead to powerful economies manipulating their inflation thereby leading to disastrous consequences in parts of the world whose currencies are not global trade currencies.</p>

<p>Are there wonderful teachers among expert economists who can
help me understand?</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>We have seen the benefits of deploying technology in many real world applications. Anyone who has used Yelp or IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes before deciding on a restaurant or watching a movie has accepted the indirect aid the (average) ratings on those sites provided about the quality of the restaurant or the movie. Anyone who has watched sports like Cricket, Tennis or Football (soccer) would be able to appreciate the role Hawk-Eye technology plays in resolving decision confusions by on-field referees or umpires. One just wonders how much of technology is used in other adjudications (like lawsuits, for example) and how technology can aid (rather than replace) such adjudications.</p>

<p>Let us take an example of such an adjudication - for example, a dispute between two parties (very much like two teams in a sport) being resolved by an adjudicator (like an on-field referee or an umpire).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In many sports, technology plays a huge role in aiding the on-field umpire or even over-turning the decisions of the on-field umpire when one of the parties was not satisfied with his original decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In cricket, this is referred to as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is8Vd_YQKwE">Decision Review System (DRS)</a> - which in turn uses several technologies like Hawk-Eye vision cameras, ball tracking technology and projection and estimation of the movement of the ball beyond the point of obstruction. How do we generalize this for any adjudication process.</p>

<p>Shown below is a general flow of what a simplified process would look like.</p>

<p><strong>Components of a Decision System</strong></p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">
  <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/tmp/main/ideas/adj_tech.PNG" /></center>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Investigation Facts</strong> These are the facts coming out of an investigation. In sports, these could be coming from several cameras and ball tracking systems. In a civil or criminal lawsuit this could be the facts compiled by a set of investigators.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Acceptable Behaviours</strong> These are the <em>fair</em> rules of the game. In sports, these could be coming from the rule book. In a lawsuit these could be the set of rules acceptable by law (and not necessarily by society).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fact Compiler</strong> is the brain of the system. It compiles the several statements in natural language into unambiguous statements in logic as a first step so that clear interpretation could be made. Then, a comparision of investigation facts against the rules of the game is made to see if all the rules were obeyed or some were not obeyed. The comparision tells us that happened that were actually allowed by the rules of the game (or by law) and what were disallowed by law.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the two parties involved in the dispute can use such a <em>Fact Compiler</em> in order to compile their facts and check what was compromised and what rules were obeyed. There might be rule breaks that one party thinks was the right thing to do and needs an adjudicator to decide taking into account the situation under which the rule break happened (injuring another person during an act of self defence, for example).</p>

<p><strong>Decision Systems</strong>
Now, the decision making system has at least three sets of facts to compare - the compiled facts from each of the two parties involved in the dispute, and the fundamental truth compiled from independent investigation and acceptable (lawful) behaviours. The decision making system can compare these three sets of facts and enumerate the lawful and unlawful behaviours (w.r.t the truth as known to the investigation compared against acceptable legal behaviours). An adjudicator can consult this set of facts in order to avoid his own bias before making an adjudication. Purists might point out that this would not reduce bias as the bias introduced by investigation and fact compiler might indeed propagate to the compiled set of facts, and that is true. The effort to reduce the bias at these stages is to make the Fact Compiler and the input facts less biased by providing “more”, “unbiased” data.</p>

<p><strong>Natural Language Understanding</strong>
While understanding natural language with context is a challenging area of Computer Science and Mathematical logic, this would pave way for an interesting area of research to encode the contexts and use that encoding while building technologies to understand natural language. One of the simplest examples why this is a challenge is to just look at the following pairs of sentences (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_flies_like_an_arrow;_fruit_flies_like_a_banana">inspired by this</a>)and guess an appropriate word for the blank in the second statement:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Time flies like an arrow
Fruit flies like a _______
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most AI systems would not guess the blank as a fruit, let alone one that rhymes with <em>arrow</em> (like <em>mango</em>). The word “like”, though the same word and spelling in both cases, alters the meaning of the statements that pure structural analysis would not help one in completing the second one. We need some semantics and context behind the statements. Another example would be to check if a given statement is a sarcastic one or a serious one. Sarcasm detection, though there are partially successful approaches, is a challenging area for natural language understanding systems.</p>

<p><strong>Automated Reasoning Engines, Logic and Encoding Facts</strong>
Many of the reasoning engines built for reasoning about the correct of computer programs (a set of program statements with a specific syntax (syntax of the programming language), much like the set of facts in English) work on <a href="http://www.manyworldsoflogic.com/predicateLogic.html">predicate logic</a> and there are well known automated solvers to solve a set of facts encoded in this logic. However, encoding contexts and possibilities would involve more than just predicate logic - it might involve modal logic and epistemic logic. A single reasoning engine would do the logical consistency check and derive the consequences (a set of facts) from known facts (provided by the supporting documents) based on encodings of rules of law (the axioms). Once the individual facts from investigations are compiled into precise mathematical statements by the <em>Fact Compiler</em>, rather than ambiguous English statements, the checker can be implemented using technologies behind reasoning engines used in program verification. While research in this area is progressing, it is also important to keep an eye on the applications - like lawsuits as legal statements in English language might require more effort to encode rather than informal statements in English language.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While aiding an adjudicator is an important part of the technology, encoding the facts, at each level of the process, as statements in mathematical logic would allow allow one to play back the compiled judgement (a set of facts) to understand how those facts were arrived at, from the initial sets of facts (like investigations and laws).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be a huge step in explaining the decision made (this would be the cornerstone of an explainable AI system). It would also provide a valuable tool for adjudicators to replay different decisions to check if they would be consistent with the initial sets of facts, or even replay them with some facts removed or altered to explain how the decision would have been different in case one of the parties had done something different (been more lawful instead of breaking the law).</p>
