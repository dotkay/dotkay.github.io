        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Everyone knows GameStop now, and its ticker symbol too - gamers, non-gamers, traders, non-traders, all alike.</p>

<p>GameStop is a chain of retail stores that sells game merchandise, equipment and at one point (when games were sold on CDs) games. Retail is moving online and if the product is software, it has already moved. I can’t recollect the last time I saw Windows OS or Office sold in a CD.</p>

<p>Hedge funds apparently make money by betting on such companies - borrow money or company shares from some lender promising to repay and in the mean time, bet on the downside of the company, wait for the price to crash, buy the stock (for cheap) and give it back to the lender (pocketing the difference). I am not sure how they pick companies to bet on. However, late last year and early January, GameStop was the candidate. In order to revolt againt this, some online enthusiasts mobilized themselves to buy options on this stock, thereby increasing the stock price (‘stock price’ not ‘company value’) that would hurt the Hedge funds’ intentions.</p>

<p>Let us look at some data to see if Hedge funds are the real detterants to GameStop’s future or if there are other factors - like streaming. It was not just GameStop (GME), but also Nokia (NOK), AMC and Blackberry (BB) that went through this early January, but GameStop had the biggest change. Just to show the trend in these stocks (GameStop removed from the plot below as the change in GME was too high that the other trends wouldn’t show up well). Notice how the overall trend in stock prices have been over the last few years and how it changed towards the end of 2020 and early 2021.</p>

<p>In order to see what (game) streaming industry is like, I started looking for data on this - number of subscribers, streamers, etc. I found <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/statistics">Twitchtracker</a> that tracks statistics on Twitch. Since Twitch’s data was easiest to get and well organized, I decided to look at just Twitch data (number of concurrent viewers) and plot it alongside GameStop stock price over the years.</p>

          <p>A week ago Tesla Motors (TSLA) joined the S&amp;P 500 Index - the stock market index that keeps track of the performance of 500 largest companies listed in stock markets in the US. Overall TSLA has been very volatile - many argue that the volatility (risk) indicates the opportunies for Tesla. Now that we are towards the end of the year, a pandemic year, let’s see how the S&amp;P 500 performed and how Tesla performed.</p>

          <p>Since time immmorial, humans have been interested in astronomy and space. This can be dated back to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgjcy04PDRM">work of Aryabhatta</a> and the ideas of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPaq8sf8Ko">Greek astronomers</a> like Aristotle. However, human journey to space, as we know today, happened much later. Today, we are in a race to conquer the planets and use our knowledge of space acquired over centuries to advance many technologies.</p>

<p>Space is an important frontier for many technological advances. Global Positioning Systems (GPS), International Space Station (ISS), communication satellites, and (hopefully) very soon low earth orbit satellites beaming wireless internet are some of the greatest engineering marvels. Beyond space tourism and inhabiting Mars, there are many more important reasons why space might be very important.</p>

<p>This fun post shows the number of trips made by American and Russian astronauts and the various expeditions to space over the last two decades.</p>

          <p>We perceive our sense of self as an amalgamation of the different sensory inputs - visual, tactile, locomotive, etc., that our brain processes and interprets. Or in other words, our sense of self is an interpretation made for us by our brain (mind) after processing several inputs. In olden days philosophers who tried to understand one’s true self found it difficult to reason about the interpretation of sense of self - are we really who we are? or are we manifestations of our mind’s interpretation of several inputs? This is a fascinating topic and lately neuroscience research is trying to understand which parts of the brain are processing and how our brain creates such interpretations.</p>

<p>In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Wasnt-There-Investigations/dp/0525954198">The Man Who Wasn’t There</a>, journalist Anil Ananthaswamy takes us through the neuroscience research on this topic. The main message of this book is that our sense of self is an interpretation of several inputs which are beyond just sensory inputs but our own physical body and society play a vital role. And in this age where Computer Scientists are working on Deep Learning as well as trying to understand the neurological pathways in order to build systems that mimic the human decision making apparatus, while that apparatus itself is not completely understood.</p>

<p>What fascinates me about this study is how the mind’s computation of sense of self can be influenced (or cheated) by changing the mapping (think of it as lookup table entries) the mind preserves for different sensory and other inputs. In many cases, what we feel and believe our sense of self is, is just an interpretation (an entry in the table) that is fetched given the inputs. We can influence such inputs to pick up a different entry that would alter our sense of self. There is also a classic neuroscience experiment from the 90s that demonstrates how the mapping in our brain, representing our physical sense of self, can be altered within minutes. You can take a look at an example experiment below:</p>

</div>

<p>I am intrigued about the possibility of changing our emotional sense of self and if it could be done non-invasively using technology. Such a possibility would be a big boost to curing several mental disorders just by altering the mapping in the mind, when we know how the mapping is created, where it is stored and how it is interpreted. Also, one needs to be aware of ramifications of this - can such mappings be altered by say adversarial inputs - visual or societal - in the form of social media posts or news articles. We might be destroying our own sense of self by letting our mind interpret the inputs that we consume, without us realizing the end result - thinking we are who our mind interprets (influenced interpretation/self) rather than who we really are (actual self).</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>With online education becoming the norm due to the pandemic there is a growing debate about inequality that is brought about by access to reliable, affordable internet connectivity. At the same time, many countries in the developing world are seeing a huge increase in people connecting to the internet, many of them for the first time. With prices of internet becoming affordable in many parts of the developing world, more and more services are being offered online.</p>

<p>If the number of subscriptions in 2019 were any indicator of the growth, the pandemic has only accelerated the subscriptions. More and more of our daily activities like education, work, essential services like shopping groceries, etc. all have come to rely on internet connectivity. The mobile phone, being the most affordable computer in many parts of the world today, with an internet connectivity dictates whether you can participate in these activities or not.</p>

<iframe seamless="" frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/MobileSubscriptions_16384135133810/MobileBroadbandSubscription2019?embed=yes&amp;:display_count=yes&amp;:showVizHome=no" width="900" height="950" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>While growing internet connectivity is certainly good news, let us see how affordable they are across the globe. The cost of internet in most parts of the developing world is much less than in the west. However, the quality of internet is not as good as in the west. The visualization below shows the cost of internet (in USD) in different parts of the world as well as the mean download speed. We can see that the mean download speed is relatively poor in many parts of the world. Crucially several activities like education, work, etc. require not just a connectivity but a good one.</p>

<p>Even when the pandemic ceases to exist, many important everyday activities, commerce and essential services would require internet connectivity. With AI based upscaling technologies, we can hope that many of the educational material could be delivered even with a poor connectivity without reducing the effectiveness of the medium of delivery. In parallel, technologies like low orbit constellation of satellites delivering internet, like the ones being planned by Starlink and OneWeb should see its deployment fast enough in order to rebalance the loss created by internet inequality.</p>
