        <div class="post-content">
          <p>In this post, we will see the most ubiquitous, most useful and also the most easily mis-interpreted data visualization tools - <em>charts</em>. They come in various forms and they are used to represent different aspects of the underlying data. The key assumption is that the visual representation is easier to interpret quickly than in a tabular format. More often, one kind of story a chart conveys might hide another kind of story a different chart, of the underlying dataset, might have conveyed. It is not uncommon to find that the reader would interpret the chart in a way different from what the writer wanted to convey, in which case it is best for the writer to clarify the message being driven.</p>

<p>For example, let us look at the latest global vaccination data. When you look at the per-capita vaccination rates of different countries, and say you pick the top 50 countries, you would see a chart similar to the following (the chart below is from September, 2021). More specifically, the chart shows the number of fully vaccinated people per hundred of the population.</p>

<p><br /></p>

</div>

<p>What story does this tell? While per-capita numbers are a way to normalize the data, it crucially depends on the story that one wants to tell. Does this indicate the ease of availability of vaccines? Does it indicate the effectiveness of the healthcare system? Does this indicate the willingness of people to get the vaccine? Or something else?</p>

<p>Let us look at the absolute numbers for the same data and look at the chart.</p>

<p><br /></p>

</div>

<p><span style="color:gray; font-size: 50%; text-align: left;">
Data regarding fully vaccinated population from China was missing from the dataset and hence it does not show up in the chart. China had the most fully vaccinated population (absolute numbers) in September, 2021.
</span></p>

<p>We see a different picture. What story does this tell?</p>

<p>While both of the above charts convey useful information, it is necessary to understand what useful story could be told using the above. For example, the first chart (per-capita) could indicate what percentage of the total population is vaccinated. This could indicate to what extent the spread of the virus or hospitalizations could be contained and that very likely these countries could get out of the pandemic sooner and become safer to travel to. It does not indicate the effectiveness of the healthcare system or the challenges in getting more people vaccinated, etc.</p>

<p>The second chart shows the absolute number of people vaccinated in many countries. The difference between the two charts could show the challenges in getting the population vaccinated - it could be geographical as in some countries might be too large posing a logistics challenge, it could be the size of the population - even if enough vaccines are in supply more would be needed to get the entire population vaccinated or it could be a short supply of vaccines - again because of lack of storage or the price or a weak healthcare infrastructure.</p>

<p>On similar lines, when you look at GDP data and plot the top 50 countries by GDP the chart looks something like the following.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">

</div>
<p><span style="color:gray; font-size: 50%; text-align: left;">
The GDP numbers are from 2018 rather than latest numbers in order to avoid the variations of the effects of the pandemic on GDP.
</span></p>

<p>It shows the wealthiest countries (in terms of GDP). But does the wealth trickle down to every individual? Again, there might be challenges like population, management of funds, etc. Once you look at per-capita numbers one could see how different countries fare.</p>

<p><br /></p>

</div>

<p>When you look at the GDP growth rate, it tells a different story - the countries that are improving from their past year. Yes, Libya did have 15% GDP growth in 2018.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">

</div>

<p>The chart we choose should depend on the story we want to tell. It is imperative to explicitly explain the choice of chart and how it tells the story the writer wants to tell and also the stories it does not.</p>

          <p>This is about the stories of Summer Olympics - not just one story but many stories and not just the recently concluded Tokyo Olympics, but all of the Olympic games since the first one in Athens in 1896. Although the analysis of the medals won by different countries would make the story read like a story medals and achievements statistics, there are other stories hidden within. We will narrate many of those as we do the analysis.</p>

<p>We will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pandas</code> library to do the data analysis and plotly to create our plots that would tell a visual story.</p>

<p>When we look at the hosts we see many western powers with Brazil and China (then emerging economies) hosting in 2008 and 2016 respectively. Of course, hosting an Olympics is no small thing - the infrastructure, safety, accessibility, etc. play a huge role and many of these cost money. London seems to be the only city that has hosted Olympics thrice.</p>

<p>The number of events in each of the Olympics also seems to be different, as evidenced by the total number of medals awarded during the games. With Paris and London regularly competing for the best European City regularly I believe it is high time Paris got a chance to host the Summer Olympic games, and very glad 2024 Olympics are going to be held in Paris. I also hope more and more emerging economies to be able to host the games. The motivation and interest in sports such events would infuse is invaluable.</p>

<p>When we look at the cumulative number of medals won from the start of Summer Olympic games, USA clearly leads. But more important to note here is Russia which was more excellent in sports, science and technology, arts and culture, etc., when it was Soviet Union. Also interesting to note is the presence of an entry <em>Individual athletes</em> - athletes who chose to compete under the Olympic flag instead of any specific country. This is a political story.</p>

<p>There were many instances where athletes who requested to compete independently and were refused - for example, the ones who emigrated from Communist Europe during the cold war, as well as some during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Olympic_boycott">1976 Olympic boycott</a>. The first provisions were made by IOC (International Olympic Committee) during the 1980 Summer Olympics hosted at Moscow.</p>

<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" align="middle" src="https://plotly.com/~kkplot/15.embed" height="600" width="1000"></iframe>

<p>When we look at the countries that shine on the top of the medals table regularly the familiar pattern is clear. It is mostly European countries, USA, Australia and more recently China. Although we might have cheered Usain Boltâ€™s sprints and track and field athletics being one of the most anticipated events of the Summer Olympic games, in terms of total number of medals, many western countries top the table year after year. This also indicates the broad variety and the number of events in the summer games.</p>

<p>There is also a political story hidden here, that of the 1980 Summer Olympics. There were only two cities that bid to host the games - Los Angeles and Moscow and eventually Moscow won. If you notice the 1980 Olympics that was hosted by Moscow, Russia seems to be the clear leader in terms of number of medals. Almost always, one expects host country to win several medals, but scoring more medals than the usual competitive powers is always a big achievement. Many nations boycotted the 1980 Olympics, led by the USA to protest against the Soviet-Afghan war. It had the smallest participation - just around 80 countries.</p>

<p>There are more politics stories in Olympics. The apparent gaps in the plot below makes one wonder what happened those years. The 1916 summer Olympics, to be hosted by Berlin, were cancelled due to World War I, a first cancellation in the 20 year history of Olympics during those days. The 1940 Olympics to be hosted by Tokyo were rescheduled to be hosted by Finland (due to Japanâ€™s invasion of China in 1937) and eventually cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II. Again, the 1944 Summer Olympics to be hosted by London got cancelled due to World War II. The 2020 Olympics hosted by Tokyo was rescheduled to 2021 due to the outbreak of Covid. It took tremendous courage and organization by Japan and the participating countries to put up a great show during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Now, to finish it off, let us see how the top 25 medal winners (measured as per medals won in 2020)
have fared over the years in terms of total medals won. The rise of China as a major sporting nation is very apparent.</p>

<p>While this short post tells several stories behind the Summer Olympics, I would like to write a future post on the stories behind Paralympics which will would be stories of courge, inspiration and extraordinary commitment.</p>

          <p>Automakers are in the news lately, not for the the usual reasons like launching fully electric models of their vehicles, or factory closures or emission scandals. They are in the news because of semiconductor shortage, throwing many into a state of shock. For people following the auto industry this is only as common as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/chip-maker-for-apple-qualcomm-amd-warns-chip-shortage-to-last-through-2022">Apple, Qualcomm or AMDâ€™s woes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The rise of the ECUs</strong>
For more than a decade now, there has been more and more software and silicon that go into automobiles than steel. A typical automobile has about a couple of hundred Electronic Control Units (ECUs) which are microcontrollers each receiving inputs from different (like tire pressure, oil, seat belt, engine temperature, etc.) and producing outputs that translate to action (like a dashboard indicator light on low tire pressure, etc.). Since the cost of sensors have been going down rapidly, more and more of them are added in todayâ€™s vehicles and hence more ECUs to process them. The software that goes along is also tightly coupled with the hardware and these ECUs are bought from different OEMs. Much like a computer architecture, most of the automakers connect these ECUs through a common bus usually over a Controller Area Network <a href="https://www.engineersgarage.com/can-protocol-understanding-the-controller-area-network-protocol/">(CAN)</a>. The number of ECUs have only been increasing with the number of features. Rain sensors, daylight sensors, blind-spot sensors, parking sensors are all commonplace in todayâ€™s vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>From ECUs to DCUs</strong>
ECUs constitute a <em>decentralized</em> architecture - each ECU controls a particular function. With the increasing number of ECUs controlling critical functions like ADAS (Advanced Driver Assist Systems), autonomous driving, radars, etc., the industry has been moving to an architecture called DCU (Domain Control Unit) wherein instead of hundreds of ECUs a few DCUs would control multiple functions. This has been enabled by advances in semiconductors (performance and power) over the years and the decreasing cost of sensors. In a sense, DCUs constitute a <em>centralized</em> architecture. Much like how a PC Operating System can make way for high priority tasks, the software enabling the DCUs could prioritize critical functions. Further, this also enables flexibility and extensibility. The hardware (sensors and processing power) would remain in the vehicle and new software when installed would provide a new feature, much like how you have a CPU and memory (hardware) in your laptop and you can install Microsoft Office (software) if and when needed. From CAN, the automobiles are trying to move on to ethernet based architecture for many of the functionalities because of the faster transmission speed and more data per frame. CAN provides predictable and collision-free network access between nodes.</p>

<p><strong>Into the Future</strong>
With advanced sensors (like cameras and lidar) providing streaming, high resolution data, the processing power of the hardware needs to be beefed up in order to process them in real-time. This has enabled the makers of high performance processors to enter the market to compete with the many ECU vendors. NVIDIA and Intel are two of the major processor makers that are making their presence felt in the automotive space, besides Qualcomm and others. With hardware being the muscle, more and more value would be added by innovation in software (the mind). For example, a camera might just send frames of a snowy scene which software could then process, along with some real-time data it receives from neibouring vehicles or cellular phone towers, etc. and create an actionable insight for the actuators. Software can use the historical data from the vehicle for diagnosis and more importantly prognosis of faults. With the decreasing cost of sensors the data collected will explode in volume over time and the automotive software stack might also include a cloud component to store data for continuous processing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the importance of electronics and software has grown, so has complexity. Take the exploding number of software lines of code (SLOC) contained in modern cars as an example. In 2010, some vehicles had about ten million SLOC; by 2016, this expanded by a factor of 15, to roughly 150 million lines. Snowballing complexity is causing significant software-related quality issues, as evidenced by millions of recent vehicle recalls - <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/rethinking-car-software-and-electronics-architecture">McKinsey &amp; Co.</a></p>

<p>With most vehicles made of steel and aluminium the value differentiator was brought about by the (electronic) features over the past decade. The next decade would usher in a new era of value differentiation enabled by software innovations. Who would own the hardware and operating system (much like Windows and Intel or Android and ARM in PC and mobile generation) of the era of automobile innovation is yet to be seen.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>For more than 15 months people around the world are mostly staying indoors, those who could are working from home, vacations and other outdoor entertainments have come to a standstill. At the same time, NetFlix, gaming, and other entertainment like TV and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> must have become more popular - after all, these are the forms of indoor entertainment. I decided to look at what people have been interested within this limited set of entertainment avenues. While I could not find most data, YouTube data was available and regularly updated. I decided to download the dataset that contains YouTube data from August 2020 until early June 2021. Let us see what people (in the U.S.) have been watching on YouTube during this period.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">yt_us</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pd</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">read_csv</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'US_youtube_trending_data.csv'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">yt_us</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">dtypes</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The different features in the dataset are (after casting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">publishedAt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trending_date</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">datetime</code> type):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>video_id                          object

<p>There are different categories of videos in the dataset, and these are the number of videos in each category.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">
  <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/data_science/master/plots/n_cat_videos.png" /></center>
</div>

<p>I am surpised by the number of videos in some of the categories or the categorization itself. There is a category on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">People &amp; Blogs</code> - I am not sure what it refers to. I do know artists have their own channels and YouTube is a more lively form of a blog, but there is also Music (some of the channels there might also be by music artists). While I try and understand how the different videos are categorized, let us look at some other stats.</p>

<p>Let us find out how many aggregate views each of the different categories has:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">cat_view_count_df</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">yt_us</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">groupby</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">'categoryId'</span><span class="p">])[</span><span class="s">'view_count'</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="n">agg</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">'sum'</span><span class="p">])</span>

</div>

<p>Not surprisingly, Music, Entertainment and Gaming are right at the top. Unfortunately, Education category is way behind. I find YouTube as a wonderful source of education. But may be this is due to Coursera, Udacity, etc. having their own video encoders and decoders and do not have their content on YouTube.</p>

<p>Let us see which were the Top 50 most viewed videos during the time period, in the U.S.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># create a new column 'count_max_view' to collect max view_count

<p>Since I am fond of Education, I would like to see which YouTube channels have maxinum number of views and check if any of my favourite channels appear in the list.</p>

<p>I see a lot of interesting channels - Khan Academy seems to have just made it to the list. I also see a channel <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YouTube</code>. I see lots of interesting channel names and I hope to spend more time exploring those on YouTube very soon.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset">YouTube dataset</a> is also available for other geographies. Someday, I would like to compare how the interests in different geographies differ by comparing YouTube channelsâ€™ popularity. It may not be an accurate representation of interests at all, but it should be a fun exercise.</p>

          <p>In a <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2021/02/21/us-unemployment">previous post</a>, we saw how many jobs the different states in the U.S. have lost over the years primarily due to trade deficits. In this post, we will visually analyze the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/employment-levels-by-industry.htm">data from BLS</a> and compare the effects of 2008 recession and the ongoing pandemic on the state of employment in the U.S. across different sectors.</p>

<p>The covid-19 pandemic has definitely wrecked the employment across several sectors of the labor economy and not just the hospitality sector. If we look at the employment numbers for an year starting from January 2020, job losses are evident. We also see the quick recovery (though not to January-2020 levels) in several of the sectors.</p>

<p>If we zoom out in the data set and look at two decades of employment numbers all the way from January 2001 until January 2021, we also see the effect of 2008 recession on employment numbers. We also see how gradual and prolonged the effect of 2008 recession was. The job losses across sectors during the pandemic was sudden and steep and the recovery of numbers was also quick.</p>

<p>We can just hope that the recovery from the pandemic continues quicker and reaches early 2020 levels, not only in the U.S. but across the globe. Given that the world is very globalized today than ever before, anyone is healthy and good only when everyone is healthy and good.</p>
