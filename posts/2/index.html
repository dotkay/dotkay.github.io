        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Watching a movie with stunning visual special effects, sound effects is best done in cinema halls. The screens are wide, the hall geometry and <a href="https://www.theaterseatstore.com/blog/movie-sound-systems">sound technologies</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"><em>surrond sound</em></a> add to the experience. It is no surprise that movies like Jurrasic Park, Inception, Avengers, etc. are best watched on large screen, in cinemas. It is not just the story, it is the movie experience, besides the social aspect of being outside and the lights going down. US box office revenues were 11.32 billion USD in 2019 and 11.89 billion USD in 2018 (all time best).</p>

<p>Lately, streaming has become very popular. It gives the convenience of watching the movie as and when one wanted, without having to drive to a cinema and at much lower price. A family of four can watch several movies in their living room for a monthly service fee of about $15, while a movie ticket would cost each of the family members as much. Added to this would be popcorn and soda. Netflix and lately almost every major studio is into streaming. Traditionally, movies were run in cinemas for about 90 days before getting released in digital format. But that 90 day “windowing” is coming under a lot of pressure with many streaming services deciding to release the movies right away in digital format.</p>

<p>So, we have two interesting and opposing forces - cinema halls and streaming services. One provides the best experience while the other provides convenience and affordability. And then came the COVID pandemic. With cinema halls being the sort of place that by design invited a large gathering in an enclosed room, it provided the perfect recipe for a pandemic spread. Cinema halls are closed and people are stuck at home having not much of an entertainment - a perfect recipe for streaming services to be at their best to relieve those sheltering in place of their boredom.</p>

<p>As if the scenario is not interesting enough, it was rumored that a popular movie streaming service - Amazon Prime Video made a bid for a popular cinema chain AMC. Although nothing of this is confirmed, the very thought process in analyzing this is interesting. What would be Amazon’s interest in AMC?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Amazon has a sizeable number of prime customers who get free shipping on goods and some deals on Whole Foods stores. Would Amazon give them monthly passes or subsidized tickets to watch movies in AMC?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amazon Studios makes originals. Would those originals first be released in AMC and later streamed on Amazon Prime?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would Amazon reserve AMC for the first few weeks, for movies with stellar visual and sound effects?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would Amazon split the Studio products into TV shows like soaps for Amazon Prime and movies for AMC?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would AMC become a Hollywood talent scouting arm for Amazon?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In all these, how would the pricing work? Amazon is known for maximizing efficiency and getting the best price for the end customer. Would it be able to replicate it in box office movies? If so, how? It is an interesting aspect waiting to be seen, if the rumours are true and if the deal goes through.</p>

<p>Till then, relax on your couch and stream your favorite shows.</p>

          <p>Despite the date of posting, this post isn’t a joke and is meant to provoke some thoughts on efficiency and flexibility.</p>

<p>As a result of COVID-19 pandemic we saw the mad rush for toilet papers and other essentials that were getting swept off super-market shelves. Not just toilet papers, even face-masks and ventilators were in short supply at a time when they were most needed. Many consumer and semiconductor companies lowered their guidance due to disruptions in their supply chain. How did we get into a situation where so many industries - from toilet papers to iPhones were getting affected?</p>

<p>The world over the many years got more globalized. American or Canadian products were not made in the US or Canada. They were made in places where it was cheaper and faster to make. Even <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8">trash is sent to other countries</a> in order to be recycled in a cost-effective manner. In short, global supply chain over the years shaped its goal into one that is more cost efficient rather than being flexible. This is not the first time companies are facing shocks. Not long ago, floods in Japan resulted in supply chain issues for automotive companies.</p>

<p>Is this design for efficiency a problem? It definitely looks like, given what many countries went through as the COVID-19 pandemic stuck. Many companies were not able to reliably source their material and keep their assembly lines busy, as they were over-invested in the most (cost) efficient supply chains like in China. If instead the supply chains were designed for flexibility, the average marginal cost of a product “might be” (and just might be) a little higher but geography specific events would not throw the entire system out of gear. There is an emphasis on the uncertainity of the cost implications as it is not entirely clear at this point. For example, one could argue that, if the semiconductor industry had sourced from several geographies like China, India, Africa, South America, etc., it is very likely that the infrastructure for sustaining such supply chains would have developed in many such countries creating a healthy competition, thereby reducing the cost. And this applies to several industries, not just semiconductors.</p>

<p>Have the corporates learnt a lesson now?. There was a similar talk after supply chain disruptions in Japan, but nothing materialized in the long run. Would this time be different? One has to wait and watch.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Lately, I have been reading about several businesses and trying to understand their product offerings, value proposition of the products, business model and how they came to be. With a natural inclination for technology products and a curiosity about startups and business models, this has been an enjoyable learning experience and I am hoping to share a lot of my learning through this medium. Let’s start with LinkedIn.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Vision</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.</p>
</blockquote>

<dl>
  <dt>I liked the simple and clear vision statement but was wondering why it mentions only <em>economic opportunity</em> while LinkedIn’s products offer much more or could it be the case that all the benefits the products offer can be tied to economic opportunity? I started researching about what this term <em>economic opportunity</em> entails and found <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-are-economic-opportunities-defined">this answer</a> in Quora:</dt>
  <dt><br /></dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>When somebody is willing to pay you money for doing something that you are willing and able to do, that is an “economic opportunity”. It can be a small business idea or a job.If you can produce a product or provide a service that people are willing to pay for, that is a small business opportunity. If you have an ability or skill that an employer needs, that is a job opportunity.</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p><em>Basically, an economic opportunity is the chance to do work that somebody is willing to pay you for. You don’t have to “like” the work. You just have to be able to competently do it. If you like your work, all the better for you. But we work to earn money that is paid by other people. The work we do is for other people’s benefit. The money they pay us is for our benefit. It is a reciprocal pay-earn, demand-supply economic relationship. They pay us money for supplying them what they want.</em></p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>I, however, feel that LinkedIn also provides knowledge opportunity (learning), business/marketing opportunity (sales leads) and career opportunity (jobs for professionals) and talent development (hiring solutions for recruiters) opportunity, etc. There might be some or some aspects of these on which you cannot really put a dollar value on in order for them to be called an <em>economic opportunity</em>.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Mission</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mission of LinkedIn is simple: connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, a short and crisp mission statement. But, again I believe that the main benefit is making professionals more skilled, equipped, informed, etc., rather than just productive.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Products</strong></p>

<p>LinkedIn to many is just a networking site for professionals. But once you look at the suite of products it is much more than that. LinkedIn’s products are organized under four themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hire</li>
  <li>Market</li>
  <li>Sell</li>
  <li>Learn</li>
</ul>

<p>The various products under each of these themes are shown below:</p>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_products.jpg" alt="LinkedIn's Products" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p>It is difficult to categorize each of the products into <em>advertisement-based</em> or <em>subscription-based</em> one as some of them overlap both business models. The <em>HIRE</em> theme is mainly for human resources professionals to track, follow, and manage recruiting pipeline for their organizations. I believe this could be one of the most active products (along with learning) on the platform. The <em>MARKET</em> theme helps in setting up marketing campaigns, reach out to potential resources for marketing purposes, set up custom pages, and serve advertisements on the pages and possibly through emails. Although it sounds like a lot of features, I believe they would have a very stiff competition from the likes of Google and Facebook. Although the advertisements would be more relevant to hiring and professional marketing, the eyeballs on these wouldn’t be as much as on Google search and Facebook feeds. However, with the volume of professionals in the network, hiring ads would get the best reach on this platform. The <em>SELL</em> theme sounds like a specialized Salesforce platform.  The <em>LEARN</em> theme is an upcoming Coursera. Although it may not offer a wide variety of specializations for now, with data from the <em>HIRE</em> theme, it would be a more powerful medium for specialized skill development targeted at specific job roles in specific industries. We need to wait and watch how well Microsoft uses the data from one to better the offerings of another. Although LinkedIn membership is free, there is also a premium subscription which could be considered as a separate product in itself (creating significant revenue) and it is needed to use several of the other products, for example InMail.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s business</strong></p>

<dl>
  <dt>LinkedIn has become a significant business unit of Microsoft. According to a <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/">source</a></dt>
  <dt><br /></dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>In the 2019 fiscal year, LinkedIn brought in $6.8 billion worth of revenue, contributing to $38.1 billion of commercial cloud revenue for Microsoft, which in turn made up part of $126 billion total revenue.</em></p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Further the numbers below from Microsoft’s earnings and LinkedIn newsroom validate the importance of LinkedIn and its potential.</p>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_fy20_q1.PNG" alt="LinkedIn FY20 Q1" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_stats.PNG" alt="LinkedIn impact" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Opportunity</strong></p>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_worldwide.png" alt="LinkedIn Stats" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p>And that shows the opportunity for LinkedIn. Along with the above, GitHub - the world’s largest software development platform or the playground for developers was snapped up by Microsoft. This indicates a very huge potential. The data from <em>HIRE</em> theme above combined with <em>LEARN</em> theme and fueled by GitHub platform is a wonderful growth opportunity. GitHub + LinkedIn for developers would be Instagram for fashionistas and for businesses and recruiters this would be the Instagram for fashion brands seeking ambassadors and influencers. Probably some day very soon let me write about the opportunity for data science and AI in stitching all the above products together as one awesome fabric.</p>

<p>Thats all for now!</p>

          <p>As people who know me understand, I read articles and listen to podcasts on a variety of topics ranging from technology, social science, society, economics, etc. Economics is one of my favourites, as it is very relatable to our day to day lives, besides involving mathematical modelling (which, for the same reasons as Deep Learning techniques of today, can only be close to a very good approximation but never accurate). While listening to BBC’s Business Daily podcasts, I stumbled upon this episode on Modern Monetary Theory. The title of the podcast - “Magic Money Tree” caught my attention and it turned out to be an interesting take on a proposal by one of the former Hedge Fund manager about central banks being able to print more money when needed. I did have this idea when I was a kid before I realized inflation and value of goods and how they are tied to abundance of ciculation of money, interest rates and consumer spending. I am not an economist but I am worried how this could lead to powerful economies manipulating their inflation thereby leading to disastrous consequences in parts of the world whose currencies are not global trade currencies.</p>

<p>For those interested in listening to the episode, you can do it here:</p>

<p>Are there wonderful teachers among expert economists who can
help me understand?</p>

          <p>On this rainy Sunday in California, with not much motivation to do anything serious, with the last of the India-Australia Test series underway in Sydney delayed due to rain, I started scrolling through the library of my favourite pod-casts and this particular one caught my attention. <em>The Edge Effect</em> - an episode from NPR’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain">Hidden Brain</a> series.</p>

<p>The episode talks about the importance of encouraging and developing diversity of thoughts and ideas. It draws examples from science and music and makes compelling arguments supporting diversity. In particular, the experiments by Adam Galinsky and the life story of Cristina Pato were very impressive.</p>

<p>For those interested, here is a link to the podcast:</p>

</audio>

<p>I should take time to appreciate the diversity my parents exposed me to, while growing up in India.</p>
