          <p>I happened to complete an online course on Deep Learning and just starting to look at different products to see how machine learning or deep learning techniques could be used to make these products better. Since I understand technology products and their landscape better, I am likely to be biased in analysing more technology products than non-tech ones, although I am determined to study some non-tech industries, processes, products and services to see if (at all) and how deep learning could be used there - that is a bigger challenge and one that would stimulate our neurons more.

<p>Just happened to listen to this week’s episode of one of the recent NPR podcast series titled <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain">Hidden Brain</a> and it got me thinking a lot. I speak almost 5 languages (not fluently but to different degrees of expertise) and I am not sure how my mind thinks. One thing for sure though is that I happen to think in my mother tongue and my mind translates it in (almost) real-time while I communicate, be it talking or writing down my thoughts as I do while writing this blog post. If languages do influence our thinking and understanding and more importantly the biases we cultivate, what does it mean for language translators - do they also convey the biases that are inherently influenced by one’s language? Or as a technologist I am also inclined to think what would it mean for AI systems (say chat-bots) that are meant to facilitate communication? I now tend to believe that they have to be designed with the intricacies of languages and the influences, biases that it carries along encoded into the system in order for it to be more acceptable. Even if not as a chat-bot, it would be a great system to train people to work with people of different cultures so that we understand different cultures better and comfortably communicate taking into account their nuances.</p>

  <p>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2018/05/05/climbing-stairs-recursively">previous post</a> we saw a recursive algorithm to compute the number of ways one can climb a fleet of <em>n</em> steps. If you draw the recursion tree for such an algorithm, we would soon find that we are computing some of the sub-problems repeatedly. We can do better by remembering (i.e. storing in some data structure) what we computed so that we can retrieve it and reuse it when needed again. Or in other fancy computer science parlance, we can use <em>dynamic programming</em> technique to solve such recursive problems more efficiently.</p>

<p>Here is the recursion tree for a hypothetical problem, similar to climbing stairs from our <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2018/05/05/climbing-stairs-recursively">previous post</a> where each function call for an input parameter value <em>n</em> leads to two calls for values <em>n-1</em> and <em>n-2</em>. We can readily see, even in this very small example, that the all the function calls in the sub-tree rooted at <em>2</em> is computed again unnecessarily. One of the main ideas in dynamic programming is to store such computations so that we can reuse them when needed again.</p>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/algorithms/cpp/rec_tree.jpg" alt="recursion tree" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p>Let us try to use dynamic programming and rewrite our algorithm for computing the number of ways of climbing <em>n</em> steps. We shall use a simple array (a C++ vector) to store intermediate computations. More concretely, we will store the number of ways of climbing 1 step, the number of ways of climbing 2 steps, and so on. So, our array <code class="highlighter-rouge">ways</code> stores the number of ways - <code class="highlighter-rouge">ways[i]</code> gives us the number of ways of climbing <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> steps. As we saw in our previous post, the algorithm just needs to compute <code class="highlighter-rouge">ways[i-1] + ways[i-2]</code> for different values of <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> upto <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> and finally return <code class="highlighter-rouge">ways[n]</code> as the result.</p>

<p>An astute reader would start thinking how this is different from divide-and-conquer approaches for solving recursive problems. I will let you think about it for now and find out for yourself what  technique is beneficial for what specific structure of the recursive problem - that was already a hint there!</p>

          <blockquote>
  <p>How many different ways can you reach atop a fleet of <em>n</em> step stairs taking one or two step jumps at a time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question might ring a bell for some who have heard about an Italian mathematician who computed a similar sequence for counting rabbits in his garden. Let us think about it using a smaller example and generalize the solution. Let us say we have only 2 steps to climb. Given the constraints (1 step or 2 step climbs only), we can complete 2 steps in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1 step, 1 step</li>
  <li>2 steps</li>
</ol>

<p>2 possible ways. How about 3 steps?</p>

<ol>
  <li>1 step, 1 step, 1 step</li>
  <li>1 step, 2 steps</li>
  <li>2 steps, 1 step</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/algorithms/cpp/three_steps.jpg" alt="3 steps" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p>So, 3 possible ways. What about if we have an additional one to climb (i.e. total of 4 steps to climb)? We can do it in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1 step, 1 step, 1 step, 1 step</li>
  <li>1 step, 2 steps, 1 step</li>
  <li>1 step, 1 step, 2 steps</li>
  <li>2 steps, 1 step, 1 step</li>
  <li>2 steps, 2 steps</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/algorithms/cpp/four_steps.jpg" alt="4 steps" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p>We also notice that the number of ways of climbing 4 steps is the number of ways of climbing 2 steps + the number of ways we could climb 3 steps. Recursively, we could compute for any <em>n</em> steps, given the constraints, we could climb it by computing the number of ways of climbing <em>n-1</em> and <em>n-2</em> steps.</p>
