          <p>Keeping up with my modest goals from the <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2018/08/15/deep-learning-and-tech-products">previous post</a>, I started looking at Google’s product portfolio.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why Google? - Why not?</li>
  <li>Why their product portfolio? - there is such a rich variety catering to different customer segments.</li>
  <li>Why for this topic (analysing how machine learning and/or deep learning will impact/improve the products)? - Because we already see the impact (like Google translate, maps, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s their product portfolio, right from their webpage:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">
  <p><img src="/assets/images/products/G_product_portfolio.png" alt="Google Product Portfolio" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p>In future posts, we will pick products from this list and analyze.</p>

          <p>I happened to complete an online course on Deep Learning and just starting to look at different products to see how machine learning or deep learning techniques could be used to make these products better. Since I understand technology products and their landscape better, I am likely to be biased in analysing more technology products than non-tech ones, although I am determined to study some non-tech industries, processes, products and services to see if (at all) and how deep learning could be used there - that is a bigger challenge and one that would stimulate our neurons more. Let’s see how I fare …</p>

          <p>While driving back from a camping along with my friends and looking at the vast possibly burnt areas, we started thinking why even in the <em>so called</em> hot bed of technology (Silicon Valley) we <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/30/why-planes-cant-fight-shastas-deadly-carr-fire/">hear</a> that fire fighting aircrafts had visibility problems because of the dense smoke.

          <p>Allez les Bleus!!</p>

<p>Just happened to listen to this week’s episode of one of the recent NPR podcast series titled <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain">Hidden Brain</a> and it got me thinking a lot. I speak almost 5 languages (not fluently but to different degrees of expertise) and I am not sure how my mind thinks. One thing for sure though is that I happen to think in my mother tongue and my mind translates it in (almost) real-time while I communicate, be it talking or writing down my thoughts as I do while writing this blog post. If languages do influence our thinking and understanding and more importantly the biases we cultivate, what does it mean for language translators - do they also convey the biases that are inherently influenced by one’s language? Or as a technologist I am also inclined to think what would it mean for AI systems (say chat-bots) that are meant to facilitate communication? I now tend to believe that they have to be designed with the intricacies of languages and the influences, biases that it carries along encoded into the system in order for it to be more acceptable. Even if not as a chat-bot, it would be a great system to train people to work with people of different cultures so that we understand different cultures better and comfortably communicate taking into account their nuances.</p>

          <p>In a <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2018/05/05/climbing-stairs-recursively">previous post</a>, we saw a recursive algorithm for computing the number of ways to reach atop <em>n</em> stairs. Let’s do a similar computation, this time for computing the number of ways you can combine coin denominations to arrive at a given amount. More precisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, how many ways can you combine the denominations in such a way that the combination sums up to the target amount? You can assume that you have unlimited supply of denominations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, if you have unlimited supply of $1 and $2 currency bills, how many ways can you combine them to return a change for $3? You could give three $1 bills, or a $1 bill along with a $2 bill (or alternately, a $2 bill along with a $1 bill, which is just a duplicate of the previous case just that I kept the $2 bill upon the $1 bill while giving).</p>

<p>Let us think recursively. Given a set S = { $1, $2 } of bills, we could pick a $1 bill (to give) and now we have to think how many ways you can pick bills from our set S for the remaining amount of $2 ($3 the target amount - $1, the bill we already picked). Now, if you choose to pick another $1 bill, you have to think how many ways you can pick bills from our set S for the remaining amount of $1 ($3 the target amount - our first picked $1 - our second $1 pick). Now, we cannot pick $2 as we need only $1 and are just left with one choice - to pick another $1 from the set. This gives us one solution { $1, $1, $1 }.</p>

<p>Alternately, we could have first picked a $2 bill and then we would be left with no choice but to pick another $1, so that it adds up to $3. What we are essentially doing is picking a bill whose value is less than the target amount and then computing the number of ways you can pick bills for the remaining amount, i.e. target amount - picked bill amount (our recursive step). And if this difference becomes 0, then we have a solution that sums up to the target amount (our base case for recursion).</p>

<p>If you try the above implementation on our example with S = { 1, 2 } and target = 3, you will get <em>ways</em> to be 3. And the three ways are { 1, 1, 1 }, { 1, 2 } and { 2, 1 }. What if we want only the unique ways? How would you go about modifying the above algorithm? That is we want to collapse { 1, 2 } and { 2, 1 } as just one count - after all it does not matter if I keep the $1 bill upon $2 bill or the other way around as long as I am returning bills that sum up to $3. Think about it.</p>
