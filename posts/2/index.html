        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Lately, I have been reading about several businesses and trying to understand their product offerings, value proposition of the products, business model and how they came to be. With a natural inclination for technology products and a curiosity about startups and business models, this has been an enjoyable learning experience and I am hoping to share a lot of my learning through this medium. Let’s start with LinkedIn.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Vision</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.</p>
</blockquote>

<dl>
  <dt>I liked the simple and clear vision statement but was wondering why it mentions only <em>economic opportunity</em> while LinkedIn’s products offer much more or could it be the case that all the benefits the products offer can be tied to economic opportunity? I started researching about what this term <em>economic opportunity</em> entails and found <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-are-economic-opportunities-defined">this answer</a> in Quora:</dt>
  <dt><br /></dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>When somebody is willing to pay you money for doing something that you are willing and able to do, that is an “economic opportunity”. It can be a small business idea or a job.If you can produce a product or provide a service that people are willing to pay for, that is a small business opportunity. If you have an ability or skill that an employer needs, that is a job opportunity.</em></p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p><em>Basically, an economic opportunity is the chance to do work that somebody is willing to pay you for. You don’t have to “like” the work. You just have to be able to competently do it. If you like your work, all the better for you. But we work to earn money that is paid by other people. The work we do is for other people’s benefit. The money they pay us is for our benefit. It is a reciprocal pay-earn, demand-supply economic relationship. They pay us money for supplying them what they want.</em></p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>I, however, feel that LinkedIn also provides knowledge opportunity (learning), business/marketing opportunity (sales leads) and career opportunity (jobs for professionals) and talent development (hiring solutions for recruiters) opportunity, etc. There might be some or some aspects of these on which you cannot really put a dollar value on in order for them to be called an <em>economic opportunity</em>.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Mission</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mission of LinkedIn is simple: connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, a short and crisp mission statement. But, again I believe that the main benefit is making professionals more skilled, equipped, informed, etc., rather than just productive.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Products</strong></p>

<p>LinkedIn to many is just a networking site for professionals. But once you look at the suite of products it is much more than that. LinkedIn’s products are organized under four themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hire</li>
  <li>Market</li>
  <li>Sell</li>
  <li>Learn</li>
</ul>

<p>The various products under each of these themes are shown below:</p>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_products.jpg" alt="LinkedIn's Products" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p>It is difficult to categorize each of the products into <em>advertisement-based</em> or <em>subscription-based</em> one as some of them overlap both business models. The <em>HIRE</em> theme is mainly for human resources professionals to track, follow, and manage recruiting pipeline for their organizations. I believe this could be one of the most active products (along with learning) on the platform. The <em>MARKET</em> theme helps in setting up marketing campaigns, reach out to potential resources for marketing purposes, set up custom pages, and serve advertisements on the pages and possibly through emails. Although it sounds like a lot of features, I believe they would have a very stiff competition from the likes of Google and Facebook. Although the advertisements would be more relevant to hiring and professional marketing, the eyeballs on these wouldn’t be as much as on Google search and Facebook feeds. However, with the volume of professionals in the network, hiring ads would get the best reach on this platform. The <em>SELL</em> theme sounds like a specialized Salesforce platform.  The <em>LEARN</em> theme is an upcoming Coursera. Although it may not offer a wide variety of specializations for now, with data from the <em>HIRE</em> theme, it would be a more powerful medium for specialized skill development targeted at specific job roles in specific industries. We need to wait and watch how well Microsoft uses the data from one to better the offerings of another. Although LinkedIn membership is free, there is also a premium subscription which could be considered as a separate product in itself (creating significant revenue) and it is needed to use several of the other products, for example InMail.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s business</strong></p>

<dl>
  <dt>LinkedIn has become a significant business unit of Microsoft. According to a <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/">source</a></dt>
  <dt><br /></dt>
  <dd>
    <p><em>In the 2019 fiscal year, LinkedIn brought in $6.8 billion worth of revenue, contributing to $38.1 billion of commercial cloud revenue for Microsoft, which in turn made up part of $126 billion total revenue.</em></p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Further the numbers below from Microsoft’s earnings and LinkedIn newsroom validate the importance of LinkedIn and its potential.</p>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_fy20_q1.PNG" alt="LinkedIn FY20 Q1" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_stats.PNG" alt="LinkedIn impact" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn’s Opportunity</strong></p>

<p><br />
<img src="/assets/images/products/linkedin_worldwide.png" alt="LinkedIn Stats" class="img=responsive" /></p>

<p>And that shows the opportunity for LinkedIn. Along with the above, GitHub - the world’s largest software development platform or the playground for developers was snapped up by Microsoft. This indicates a very huge potential. The data from <em>HIRE</em> theme above combined with <em>LEARN</em> theme and fueled by GitHub platform is a wonderful growth opportunity. GitHub + LinkedIn for developers would be Instagram for fashionistas and for businesses and recruiters this would be the Instagram for fashion brands seeking ambassadors and influencers. Probably some day very soon let me write about the opportunity for data science and AI in stitching all the above products together as one awesome fabric.</p>

<p>Thats all for now!</p>

          <p>As people who know me understand, I read articles and listen to podcasts on a variety of topics ranging from technology, social science, society, economics, etc. Economics is one of my favourites, as it is very relatable to our day to day lives, besides involving mathematical modelling (which, for the same reasons as Deep Learning techniques of today, can only be close to a very good approximation but never accurate). While listening to BBC’s Business Daily podcasts, I stumbled upon this episode on Modern Monetary Theory. The title of the podcast - “Magic Money Tree” caught my attention and it turned out to be an interesting take on a proposal by one of the former Hedge Fund manager about central banks being able to print more money when needed. I did have this idea when I was a kid before I realized inflation and value of goods and how they are tied to abundance of ciculation of money, interest rates and consumer spending. I am not an economist but I am worried how this could lead to powerful economies manipulating their inflation thereby leading to disastrous consequences in parts of the world whose currencies are not global trade currencies.</p>

<p>Are there wonderful teachers among expert economists who can
help me understand?</p>

          <p>On this rainy Sunday in California, with not much motivation to do anything serious, with the last of the India-Australia Test series underway in Sydney delayed due to rain, I started scrolling through the library of my favourite pod-casts and this particular one caught my attention. <em>The Edge Effect</em> - an episode from NPR’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain">Hidden Brain</a> series.</p>

<p>The episode talks about the importance of encouraging and developing diversity of thoughts and ideas. It draws examples from science and music and makes compelling arguments supporting diversity. In particular, the experiments by Adam Galinsky and the life story of Cristina Pato were very impressive.</p>

<p>For those interested, here is a link to the podcast:</p>

</audio>

<p>I should take time to appreciate the diversity my parents exposed me to, while growing up in India.</p>

<p>I got into this discussion over lunch when I heard about the Netflix series “Black Mirror” which allows the audience to choose among a set of possible story endings. This is an excellent development, in my view, in that it not only brings more suspense and interest or attention to the content, on the lighter side it would also prevent spoilers.</p>

<p>Ever since I heard about <a href="https://newsable.asianetnews.com/kerala/after-solo-other-malayalam-films-supposed-to-have-different-endings">south Indian movies that had different climaxes</a> (although to appease the fan base in different regions), I have always wondered why not have multiple possibilities for a movie climax and serve (stream) the appropriate one depending on the goal of the movie audience - i.e., if the goal is to just watch the movie and return home happy, one could have a happy ending, if the viewer is adventurous or an FPS gamer, one could have a violent or tragic ending, etc.</p>

<p>Now that we have personalization using big data analytics everywhere, it should be possible for a streaming service to identify the likes and dislikes of the audience based on previous perferences, reviews, age, likes, and the many similar features to identify the best climax for each specific viewer, besides providing the viewer the choice to choose from alternate climaxes. Of course, the cost is in the making of several different versions of a movie or TV series which in a way could be reduced using today’s CGI that only gets better over time. The upshot would be more viewership and more discussion centered around the various climaxes. Instead of viewers just watching the movie and rating them, each different climax of the same movie would get rated by different personalities. Such a service could also stream a movie ending in such a way as to cheer you up when you are dull or to pump you up when you are demotivated. Movies will never be the same again!</p>

<p>If such a personalization of streaming content were to happen who would lead the way? Would it be Amazon Fire TV who has the machine learning backend to make personalization happen, NetFlix who has the influence to get the producers to make several interesting versions of a movie or TV series or Apple TV service if Apple were to get its innovation crown back? What do you think?</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Happy New year friends!</p>

<p>What a year 2018 has been for the topic of privacy and security - from the most loved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html">social network</a> scrambling for clues to save themselves to the other <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/10/google-to-shut-down-early-after-privacy-flaw-affects-over-50m-users">social network</a> built by the world’s best engineers still couldn’t save their data, besides struggling to stay relevant. While Europe was quick to pass <a href="https://eugdpr.org/">GDPR</a>, many other countries even in the developed world are yet to catch up with such laws and regulations. 2018 was also the year that saw the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/28/smart-speakers-hit-critical-mass-in-2018/">surge in smart speakers</a> and home automation - isn’t that ironic?</p>

<p>But this story is not about the past, but about the future. Many top technology and auto companies rushing to fulfill the promise of self-driving or autonomous vehicles. It will definitely become a reality, to some extent, in at least the parts of the world where the infrastructure supports it. But the notion of foolproof security for such a technology is far from being achieved. With smartphone apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Google+ security issues, we have only scratched the surface of the malevolent intent that is possible. Once autonomous vehicles and other IoT devices reach critical mass, the security issues are only going to multiply manifold and the impact of security flaws can have disastrous consequences. Imagine a malicious attacker taking control of traffic lights that talk to cars or cars talking to other cars to negotiate who gets to cross an intersection, or a mass rapid transit system that reroutes itself or changes frequency of rides depending on real-time ridership information using neural network based predictions. Imagine the impact of such a thing gone wrong. With the current day deep learning algorithms themselves not being tractable (i.e. one can not reliably track the computation from input data to the prediction step by step as in <a href="https://skymind.ai/wiki/symbolic-reasoning">symbolic AI</a>) it is going to be more challenging to resolve a security issue even after having identified it. Apologies for being pessimistic - but one should see this as a challenge for computer architecture and computer security research - a great time to be working in any of these fields.</p>
