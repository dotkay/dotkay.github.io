        <div class="post-content">
          <p>A <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2022/02/22/languages-culture-communication">previous post</a> spoke about state-of-the-art NLP systems that are based on Transformers and some of the challenges around using such systems for translations. Although they could translate almost accurately, they may not match the nuances of spoken (informal) languages. There are other challenges around <em>Question Answering</em> systems - another tasks such NLP systems are capable of doing. In this post, this is explored futher to see when some computation (as in logical inference rather than mathematical inference) is needed to come up with an answer. We play with <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> APIs to see how the state-of-the-art NLP systems excel at language understanding and also where they have gaps to fill.</p>

<p>English, like many other languages, is a little ambiguous. There are well established rules of English grammar but I believe there are several statements in common parlance that have introduce some ambiguity. While I tried <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, in particular the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">text-davinci-002</code> engine on a variety of English statements and the results were astounding, when I kept going on, there were some statements where the answer was not exactly clear.</p>

<p>One of the was what <em>she</em> refers to in a statement like <em>Anna hit Clara because she was drunk</em>. Though it looks ambiguous I believe as <em>Anna</em> is the subject, the <em>she</em> in the statement must refer to <em>Anna</em>. OpenAI does seem to tell me that the <em>she</em> in the statement refers to <em>Anna</em>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-002",
      prompt="Anna hit Clara because she was drunk.\n\nQ: Who was drunk?\nA:",
      top_p=1,
      ...
    )
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(response)
{
  "choices": [
    {
      ...
      "text": " Anna was drunk."
    }
  ],
...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If I rephrase the above statement as <em>Anna hit Clara because she was drunk. Was Clara drunk?</em>, OpenAI was humble enough to admit that it does not know, which is impressive as there isn’t enough context to infer if <em>Clara</em> was drunk.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-002",
      prompt="Anna hit Clara because she was drunk.\n\nQ: Was Clara drunk?\nA:",
      ...
      stop=["\n"]
    )
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(response)
{
  "choices": [
    {
      ...
      "text": " I don't know."
    }
  ],
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What impressed me the most was the ability to do formulaic calculations and return an answer.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-002",
      prompt="The sale price of a decent house in California is about a million dollars. 20%
      of the price needs to be paid as down payment. In addition, the county levies a 
      property tax of 1.2% on the sale price of the house. John takes a 30 year fixed rate 
      mortgage at 3.5% interest rate.\n\nQ: What would be John's monthly cost of ownership? 
      \nA:",
      ...
    )
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(response)
{
  "choices": [
    {
      ... 
      "text": " John's monthly cost of ownership would be $4,167."
    }
  ],
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the ability to solve when numerical information was provided was too impressive, there was some struggle when the answer involved logical interpretation and numerical computation. For example, the query in the following requires interpreting what “boundary” is and how it contributes to the answer.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-002",
      prompt="Dhoni scored a single off the first ball of the 11th over. Sachin scored two
      consecutive boundaries followed by a single. Dhoni hit the biggest six of the match. 
      He then followed it up with a single and retained strike. \n\nQ: How many runs were 
      scored off the 11th over? \nA:",
      ...
    )
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(response)
{
  "choices": [
    {
      ...
      "text": " 15"
    }
  ],
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Human languages are such that they involve logical interpretation, deduction and computation. It is precisely this challenge that leads to misinterpretation, miscommunication and chaos - you can think of the last time a celebrity or a politican claimed his comments were misinterpreted or taken out of context. However, we as human beings deal with these every day and are attuned to the fallacies and inaccuracies. Our communication system, the one that distinguishes us from many other species, is itself a stochastic one.</p>

<p>Some statements require logical deduction which is challenging for deep learning systems (that learn from patterns contained in a training corpus). For example,</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-002",
      prompt="marco passed the ball to miel, miel quickly gave it to don who passed it on to
      sky. sky ran with it for a while and gave it to anna.\n\nQ: Does marco have the ball 
      now?\nA:",
      ...
   )
   &gt;&gt;&gt; print(response)
{
  "choices": [
    {
      ...
      "text": " No"
    }
  ],
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the system is able to deduce that <em>marco</em> does not have the ball, a deduction performed to answer <em>who has the ball?</em> doesn’t seem to work well.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; response = openai.Completion.create(

<p>There is immense research interest in this area and the progress being made is as impressive as that has been achieved so far. Hopefully, in a future post, I will be able to show an NLP system that combines logical reasoning with deep learning and is able to answer much more fancier questions. I am looking forward to it.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Languages have always played a very important role in society and in our cultural evolutions. It has been the vehicle that allowed human beings to collaborate, coexist and achieve great things as well as to deceive, conspire and destroy. Languages have also evolved over time carrying with them many cultural norms, shades of history while also losing some. The same language might sound differently across an ocean or even across geographic land boundaries. Some languages like Sanskrit, though less ambiguous and more efficient, are struggling to survive while others like English are flourishing despite being more ambiguous. In the age of AI based natural language processing (NLP) is it possible to encode some of these norms and cultural connotations in order to make automated translations more close to native spoken languages?</p>

<p>NLP systems are a commonplace today, mostly in the form of personal assistants like Alexa and chatbots like a customer service system. While they are able to understand and respond to usual queries or translate text to a surprising level of accuracy, they are far from matching human levels of communication. My claim is that NLP research is yet to discover the means to encode the several cultural connotations that come with languages, especially while translating from one to another. While NLP algorithms like LSTM and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformers</a> implicitly encode some of the context needed for better understanding of a statement, a pair of languages might be too different to capture all the context implicitly. Is capturing all of the context necessary? May not be. However, capturing important nuances might be.</p>

<p>I have been playing around with the <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> API for quite sometime and really enjoying the easeness of use - ability to work with different popular transformer models for different types of NLP tasks. And of course, the ability to use several different famous models makes the result almost unbelievable. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipeline()</code> - fundamental component in the <em>Transformers</em> library serves as a pipeline between the different steps in an NLP pipeline. For example, we may want to connect a preprocessing step to an analysis step and then to a post-processing step. I believe the ease of use and the availability of several models makes Hugging Face the go-to tool for NLP.</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">transformers</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">pipeline</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When instantiating, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipeline()</code> expects the user to provide the NLP task we are interested in performing as well as an optional model (when not provided, a default model is used).</p>

<p>We can create, for example, a sentiment analyzer by providing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sentiment-analysis</code> as the task. If we do not specify a model to be used, it defaults to Distilbert model.</p>
<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">sanalyzer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pipeline</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'sentiment-analysis'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can pass strings that we want to analyze the sentiment for.</p>
<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">sanalyzer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"I plan to learn"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and it returns the sentiment and a score of the sentiment.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9988747239112854}]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So “learn” seems to be a positive thing to do. Let’s keep going with this:</p>
<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">sanalyzer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"I plan to learn Spanish"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'label'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'POSITIVE'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'score'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.9941837191581726</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, learning Spanish also seems to be a positive thing to do. However,</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">sanalyzer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"I plan to learn some more Spanish."</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'label'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'NEGATIVE'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'score'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.9369450807571411</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I am not sure why, but learning some more seems to have a negative connotation (may be “some more” indicates some lacking that one is trying to improve upon?). However, if I add an additional phrase the overall sentiment seems to become positive.</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">sanalyzer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"I plan to learn some more Spanish. I want to be able to live and work in Spain."</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'label'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'POSITIVE'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'score'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.9970537424087524</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These are just some of the challenges with current NLP systems. The result could be interpreted in several ways and if the training (of which a model is a result of) was done on specific set of (data from a specific culture or a communication pattern), some phrases might get inferred as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEGATIVE</code> though it would not seem negative to the user of such systems. Another example showing a subtle difference:</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">sanalyzer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"I plan to learn enough Corporate Finance in order to get a great job"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'label'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'NEGATIVE'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'score'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.5767139792442322</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>returns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEGATIVE</code> sentiment while</p>
<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">sanalyzer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"I plan to learn Corporate Finance in order to get a great job"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'label'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'POSITIVE'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'score'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.902138888835907</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>returns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POSITIVE</code> one:</p>

<p>More intriguing are the expressions that we use depending on cultures and traditions. In many languages, we use different pronouns and verb conjugations depending on if we are talking to elders using a formal language or talking to friends or children (informal language) - like <em>vous</em> vs <em>tu</em> in French, <em>aap</em> vs <em>tum</em> in Hindi, <em>avar</em> vs <em>avan</em> in Tamil, <em>iyaal</em> vs <em>ival</em> in Malayalam, etc. Humans have learnt to make that judgement call even when we talk over the phone - we choose formal or informal language depending on how much respect or importance we attach to the person we are talking to, even if it is a stranger and we are speaking to them for the first time. However, NLP systems do not have that context explicitly encoded and it is difficult to implicitly encode them as some languages do not have such differences and while translating from such languages, one would have to possibly over-correct.</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">en_fr_translator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pipeline</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"translation_en_to_fr"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">en_fr_translator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Would you like some coffee?"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'translation_text'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'Avez-vous envie de prendre du café ?'</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we see, we could offer coffee to a close friend (informal language) or we could be a barista offering coffee to a stranger or a customer (using formal language). These are very difficult to encode implicitly. Even when there are some clues in the statement, like the following sentence which talks about <em>balloons</em> which most likely only children would be interested in, most systems would prefer a formal language in order to be absolutely correct.</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">en_fr_translator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Do you want a balloon?"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'translation_text'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'Voulez-vous un ballon?'</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are also everyday language (colloquial) that differs from a more grammatically correct business or literary language. At times, the differences between the two is so large that chatbots may sound weird. Let us contrast English-French translation with French-English translation to check this.</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">en_fr_translator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"There's no one here."</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'translation_text'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"Il n'y a personne ici."</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In spoken French, <a href="https://qr.ae/pvKYf3">one usually leaves out the negation (<em>ne</em>) in certain cases</a> and so “<em>Il y a personne ici.</em>” would also actually mean “<em>There’s no one here.</em>”</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">fr_en_translator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Il y a personne ici."</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'translation_text'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"There's no one here."</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another example, which might sound very counter-intuitive for people new to the French language.</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">en_fr_translator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"I have"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'translation_text'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"J'ai"</span><span class="p">}]</span>
<span class="n">en_fr_translator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"more bread."</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'translation_text'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'plus de pain.'</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Such statements are not always compositional.</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">fr_en_translator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"J'ai plus de pain."</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="s">'translation_text'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"I don't have any more bread."</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Many NLP systems are trained on formal and informal phrases and hence would be great translators, they may not always be a great teacher. The fluidity of languages makes languages evolve, creating new words, phrases, letting go some rules of grammar and these are exactly what make languages beatiful and a treasure trove for linguists. These are also the same challenges that make NLP a fascinating subject for Computer Scientists. I am eagerly looking forward to understanding the research in this area hoping that there would be some architecture that would enable us encode some of these connotations implicitly, making NLP systems crawl a little closer towards human-like spoken languages.</p>

          <p>If you are someone who has been watching Formula One over the last decade, it would be safe to bet that you agree 2021 has been one of the exciting year in the sport. Lots of uncertainity, lots of controversies, new, young and energetic racers, and a super-busy calendar with 22 races. In this post, we will look at the last decade in the sport while doing so using Python and Pandas to analyze, plot and visualize the data.</p>

<p>Mercedes is clearly the front runner, most of it contributed by Lewis Hamilton as we will see very soon. Having lived in Italy and a Ferrari Fan, it is sad to see Ferrari in second place and even more sad to see the downward trend for the prancing horse.</p>

<p>Let’s turn to the drivers who play a key role in making the sport what it is. After Mike Schumacher’s retirement, there was some competition between Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton and to some extent Fernando Alonso and Nico Rosberg. Unfortunately Sebastian Vettel’s dominance faded away and Lewis Hamilton started dominating every race. Very soon there was a new kid in the block - <em>Max Verstappen</em>. Young, energetic and impatient, Max Verstappen, racing for RedBull, quickly started dominating the sport throwing a big challenge to Lewis Hamilton. Many predicted his dominance given the last couple of years and if there was even the slightest of doubts, the 2021 racing season would have cleared those away. Just before the last race, Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen were tied on the same number of points which shows the sheer scale of the competition.</p>

<p>We can also see the maximum points scored by the drivers in any year. This shows Lewis Hamilton dominating the races that were once dominated by Sebastian Vettel.</p>

<p>We can also see which countries have scored the most points. Traditionally, Formula One has been more popular in Europe than the rest of the world. There are and were South American champions but not many of them. I believe this might be due to the cost involved in the sport and few can afford it. Further most of the best automobile makers are from Europe (and few from Japan as well). We can attempt to draw a tree map using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">squarify</code> in Python.</p>

<p>In all, 2021 was a fantastic year for Formula One. I wish the most crucial and deciding race had not ended in a controversial way. Sergio Perez played the best team-mate and tons of thanks to Lewis and Max for the entertainment.</p>

<p>Looking forward to more competition in 2022.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>A <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2021/10/01/metaverse-drivers/">previous post</a> outlined several drivers of metaverse. While it is still in its nascent stages, metaverse would bring truly immersive environments whose applications would span beyond video games. With the trends in virtual and augmented reality, there are immense economic opportunities as well as implications.</p>

<p><strong>Gaming:</strong> The most widely accepted and widely talked about application is, of course, <em>gaming</em>. Game developers have been creating virtual worlds for decades - so what is different now?. With advances in hardware accleration and Deep Learning algorithms, virtual world experience is becoming more and more realistic than in previous generations of games. For example, techniques like real-time ray tracing were known for a very long time. These are beginning to become practical and a commonplace only recently. So are techniques like super sampling techniques using Deep Learning, as well as other compression techniques that enable creating Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH) packing more details about the scene. With Deep Learning techniques playing an increasing important role in simulating physics, more interactive and immersive games can be developed that generate close to accurate physics (flames, movement, flow, etc.) making graphics more realistic. There is enough economic opportunity in gaming and with game streaming it has been growing at an accelerated pace. One can check out the <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/statistics">Twitch Streaming Statistics</a> and get convinced.</p>

<p><strong>Advertising:</strong> If I am watching a live sports event on TV (like soccer) from San Francisco, I would see advertisements pertaining to the local (US) market, while the same game, in an Italian feed, will have advertisements tailored to the European market. This is already a well-known and mature technology called <em>virtual replacement perimeter technology</em>. <a href="https://supponor.com/"><em>Supponor</em></a> is one of the leaders in this space. Metaverse would enable to take this a step further. The commercials would not only get specialized or tailored according to the local market where it is being broadcasted live but also according to each viewer’s personal preferences. Much like how Google’s digital advertising and the growth of mobile and social networks allowed personalized, targeted ads, metaverse would offer such opportunities in a more immersive arena. Technologies pioneered by companies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnZaItawYg">Mirriad</a> for product placement would be extremely valuable and amenable to personalization, not just for live concerts and live sports but many varieties of content created for the metaverse. Of course, there needs to be sufficient guard-rails and transparency and there would also be renewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_F5GxCwizc">debates on native advertising</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Factory Automation:</strong> Like gaming, this is one of the other avenues being talked about. There is one major difference between the virtual world (metaverse) created for gaming and the one created for factory automation purposes. For gaming, the artifacts that make up the metaverse is completely upto the imagination of the creator. However, in the case of factory automation, the digital twin has to replicate a physical structure that already exists. Any change in structure or function created (imagine the direction of conveyor belt in an assembly line) in the physical world has to be reflected in the digital twin. There is also less freedom on what artifacts could to be in the digital twin (metaverse). If many factories have identical assembly lines (like many traditional automobile factories or soft-drink bottling units, etc.) one could work with a templated setup. This would involve creating the artifacts common to all these templates (using Graphics SW tools, videos of factory, AI, etc,.). Further even if many factories share common templated factory floors at a high-level, there might be efficiencies that are introduced at the micro level (kinds of robot-arms they use, kinds of automated inspection mechanisms, etc,.) and these would be the key differentiators leading to competitive advantage. There might be commodity goods made by manufacturers who have no apparent competitive advantage over other similar manufacturers (think of zippers, nails, bottle-caps, automotive brakes and lately some semiconductor components, etc,.) for whom creating a digital twin would be easier. But they are also the ones who would move slowly on such innovations as their business becomes more and more commoditized. On the other hand factories who have a great competitive advantage (in terms of operational efficiencies) can leapfrog by having a centralized view of global factories and bringing them all to the same efficient mode.</p>

<p><strong>E-commerce:</strong> Advances in technologies like photogrammetry and depth-sensing cameras becoming a commonplace in most smartphones can bring about new innovations in e-commerce. Most of e-commerce today is centered around purchase based on reviews from trying the product offline. It becomes interesting when purchases of clothes and accessories are made as one has to trust the size, fit, etc,. Customers tend to purchase multiple sizes only to return some of them back. Though many never realize, the returns in brick-and-mortar stores is around 8-9% while online retailers can see <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/free-returns-online-shopping/620169/">as much as 30% of the products returned</a>. It runs to <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/428-billion-merchandise-returned-2020">billions of dollars worth</a> of merchandise. <em>Virtual trial rooms</em> could pop up at many points of interests (shopping malls, cinemas, etc.) or even in your living room (using a VR head-set and a phone camera or a Kinect system) that would allow one to try out new clothes. It could be tied to other marketing avenues (cross-selling) like selecting a design from a fashion show or a TV series and trying them as and when watching those shows.</p>

<p>High-end fashion is already experimenting with <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/the-augmented-and-virtual-reality-opportunity-for-luxury">augmented reality</a>. Who doesn’t want to go watch virtual French Open sitting next to friends from around the world while wearing your favorite Rafa Nike virutal t-shirt having the <em>Raging Bull</em> logo? Merchandises are already common in many video games and it could seamlessly get into fashion and other virutal events. Given the growth in influencer economy, it would also be an innovative way for amateur fashion designers to showcase their designs and their brand.</p>

<p><strong>Healthcare and Bio-informatics:</strong>
Over the last decade, we have seen increased adoption of robotic surgery - devices like <a href="https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/products-and-services/da-vinci">DaVinci systems</a> have been installed in several hospitals around the globe as it minimizes direct human contact during surgery and reduces infection rates. However, Da Vinci is a robotic arm controlled by a skilled surgeon along with mounted cameras and associated image processing software. With decreasing cost of sensors and advancements in software, a sophisticated array of sensors attached to the robotic arm could provide vital information overlaid (augmented reality) on the camera images of the surgery would provide real-time information that could aid in real-time and critical decision making.  With advancements in 5G and networking bandwidths, Da Vinci like systems could one day make remote surgeries possible. Here’s where metaverse systems could play a huge role. Effectively collaborating with different expert surgeons connected to the robotic arm from different parts of the globe would require the image processing software to be capable of showing different views, different sets of vital information in real-time to different surgical experts and also keep each of the surgeons informed of what the other surgeon is trying to do. This requires a lot of image processing, processing data from different sensors in real-time, syncronizing the views of different surgeons and doing it all in real-time. Technologies such as these would also play a vital role in medical education, to train more professionals in places where such high-end technologies may not be very common.</p>

<p>MRI is another evolving technology with more and more software components, especially image fusion and augmented reality components, along with advances in physics. There is a <a href="https://global.canon/en/technology/support28.html">very nice explanation of MRI in Canon’s webpage</a>. A keen observer would be able to already notice the various places where imaging technology could be improved many folds using techniques like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/">DLSS</a> and the like. Image processing applications in a plethora of fields are getting better using Deep Learning techniques, including such <a href="https://us.medical.canon/products/magnetic-resonance/aice/">medical imaging systems</a>.</p>

<p>Research in <em>genome sequencing</em> has advanced leaps and bounds over the last decade. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses developed using systems like Illumina provide a high-resolution base-by-base view of the genome. Softwares like TruSight combine the features used by different experts all in one dashboard and provide several ways of visualization and analysis. Softwares like these are testament to the convergence of hardware, system software, graphics and image processing and collaboration softwares as well as techniques like machine learning, all of which are required for research in areas like bio-informatics. With metaverse like platforms many experts can tap into the same analysis done in one molecular biology lab, and can sort them in different ways depending on the remote biologist’s expertise. While one might be an expert in variant filtering, the other might be an expert in evidence retrieval.</p>

<p><strong>Fitness and Active Sports:</strong></p>

<p>Though technologies in fitness got a big boost during the pandemic, mostly due to the interest in exercise equipments like Peloton bikes, sports science has been an active field of research by many global brands like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paY4xxiQNEU">Nike</a>. Companies like Google have already mapped the many streets of the world, with popular places having more detailed maps. It would be great to integrate this information with a AR/VR headset that would allow one to do <a href="https://www.giroditalia.it/"><em>Giro d’Italia</em></a> right from one’s living room on a stationary bike. It could even be possible for me to go on a ride with my friends (all of whom are in their stationary bikes probably in their living rooms or patios in different parts of the world), while turning around to talk to them or turning back to check on a slower rider. These require enormous graphics processing power (enabled by GPUs) combined with image processing software (enabled by AI) and a high bandwidth internet connectivity (enabled by 5G). For sports physicians, trainers and training apps this would also enable to monitor their customer’s vital information in real-time as and when they are working out and provide corrective information and guidance.</p>

<p>There are several business opportunities in the metaverse and several more would emerge. There are several challenges, especially around security of such systems. The success would however down to the right business model as well as focussed, deliberate execution. We might still see several companies getting on the metaverse bandwagon as did several newspaper companies thought internet was just about creating a website without understanding the distribution and personalization powers of the internet. There would be several “me-too” businesses trying to ride the “metaverse hype” without a sustainable business model, while a few who are deliberate would turn out to be the Amazons and Googles of the next decade.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Lately, we have been hearing a lot about the <em>metaverse</em>. Although this concept is not new, it has been brought to the limelight because of the huge bets and brand name changes from the potential big players in this space. However, the metaverse that is talked about today is different from what the current state of the internet offers and there are some key technological developments that are drivers of the metaverse and different companies are equipped with different strengths in order to join the competition.</p>

<p>Avatars and game environments have been around for quite some time, especially in immersive video games. The metaverse is much more than avatars or fancy immersive experiences as in video games. It is a platform, rather than a stand-alone application. It is a platform where several applications can be plugged in and get the benefits of the platform. This might be one of the probable reasons a social media messaging company recently rebranded itself. The new brand could mean a platform much bigger than social media, where social media would be just one of the components that could be plugged in. The metaverse combines AR (Augmented Reality) with communication and collaboration tools and in some cases with the help of VR (Virtual Reality) that results in an immersive, photorealistic communication, collaboration and entertainment experience. Many technological developments that happened over the course of the last decade are key to the big bets on the possibilities of metaverse.</p>

<p>The main technological advancements could be grouped under the following categories.</p>

<p><strong>Graphics Hardware (Semiconductors)</strong>
Computer processors have not just packed more and more transistors but the capabilities of graphics hardware have grown by leaps and bounds the last decade. The semiconductor process technology, new memory technologies, new functions and features driven by deep learning applications, real-time ray tracing, etc. have enabled a new era of computation possibilities at scale that until recently required expensive servers running over long periods of time in order to achieve the same computation. A big part of this is driven by semiconductor process technology (32nm in 2009 to 5nm in 2020) that enabled packing several transistors in a small area (of the die). Similar advances in memory technologies (3D stacked DRAM, advances in DDR as well as HBM and other new memory technologies) helped in increasing the on board storage by a large factor, as required by heavy graphics applications. Similar advances have also resulted in packing enough computation in small form factors like mobile phones, security cameras and other IoT devices. It has resulted in our ability to play games with a reasonably good graphics on our mobile phones. It has also enabled IoT devices to perform data analytics real time as and when they collect sensory data on the field.</p>

<p><strong>Graphics Software (VR, AR, Photogrammetry, etc.)</strong></p>

<p>If hardware was all that was needed, it would have been a commodity. The software layer brings in the innovation that software companies constantly compete to better each other at. For example, irrespective of intel or M1 processor the software layer should ensure that the applications work seamlessly across hardware configurations and operating systems. The more tied the hardware is to the software layer, more performance can be squeezed out of the hardware. Many of the graphics applications need a tremendous amount of compute power. This is especially true for photorealistic graphics. Even given the advances in semiconductors, especially graphics processing units, graphics software innovations require a mix of technology, science and art. While most software companies excel at technology, few excel in combining the three. Graphics components are relatively easy to create, but rendering photo-realistic graphics in real time in different form factors is not straight forward. Advances in AI techniques like Deep Learning Super Sampling (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/dlss">DLSS</a>) and post-processing techniques like Temporal Anti-Aliasing (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/es-la/drivers/txaa-anti-aliasing-technology/">TAA</a>) techniques have helped tremendously. Techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry">photogrammetry</a> play a vital role in creating digital twins of artifacts, besides 3D cameras and effective and scalable stitching algorithms. AR also involves merging the physical world (camera sensed) augmented with layers of graphics content. Since motion of objects is the undoubted constant in all VR and AR experiences (as anyone who has watched YouTube 360 videos or played with an Oculus headset can attest), simulating physics is the next challenge to overcome. Simulating physics, beyond fire, waves and wind in Computer Graphics is a non-trivial task that requires <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8yzFfSrDAg">simulating different materials</a> like stones, marbles, snow, etc., besides their interactions with light rays (reflection, refraction, etc.) and rendering caustics. Although today’s graphics is a major leap from a decade ago, metaverse would demand a much higher quality of photorealistic real-time graphics.</p>

<p><strong>Internet, 5G and streaming games</strong></p>

<p>Metaverse has the potential to change collaboration and media consumption in ways internet changed marketing and commerce. The advances in the same technologies (web2.0, fiber optics, mobile internet, 3G, 4G) that propelled internet adoption would also catalyze technologies like metaverse. Over the last few decades, internet has completely transformed how we consume media content (streaming media, social media, etc. compared to print and television) and how we collaborate (Webex, Zoom, Google Docs, etc. compared to telephone calls and fax messages) increasing both efficiency and effectiveness. The internet infrastructure already being able to stream online games and movies and constantly improving bandwidth and connectivity, companies can safely bet on further improvements that would support applications in the metaverse. New and upcoming technologies like 5G would bring bandwidth intensive applications like gaming within reach for mobile consumers. As adoption increases there would be new opportunities for businesses with new and innovative business models emerging out of it, much in the same way internet created a wide array of marketplace business models (Amazon, Uber, Doordash, etc.). Many doubted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GltlJO56S1g">Amazon’s</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gipL_CEw-fk">Microsoft’s</a> potential at the beginning of the internet era. The companies that do not see the potential of the metaverse might get left behind when the potentials are realized by the leaders.</p>

<p><strong>Social Networks</strong></p>

<p>The current decade has seen an interesting growth in content creation. The growth of social media enabled everyone to interact and showcase their talent. Specifically, apps like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok made it possible for independent content creators and small businesses to reach and market their products and services effectively in a cost-efficient manner. Gaming is inherently a social activity. The more immersive or innovative games are, the more attention they get (e.g. <a href="https://www.inc.com/josh-linkner/the-disruptive-innovation-behind-pok-mon-go.html">Pokemon Go</a>). When we think about it, there are many activities like movies, theatre, live sports, education, etc. that are also social activities, or at least the experience is enriched a lot when done as a social activity. Metaverse could offer these activities in the virtual world - for example, right from your living room in Singapore, you could watch US open, sitting in front-row seats at Arthur Ashe stadium, wearing your VR headset sitting next your close friend who is wearing another VR headset and is sitting in his living room in Sydney. Though we might be inclined to think that popular social media players would have an advantage in metaverse, we could also see new innovative players who could change the game. The bottom line is that for many of these social activities, metaverse would offer a much richer experience than what the current internet offers.</p>

<p>There are many other drivers that might directly or indirectly influence the adoption like enterprise communication and collaboration applications like WebEx or Zoom extended to factory floors rather than just computer screens, virtual tourism and adventure trips, etc. It is difficult to predict if metaverse would succeed but it is definitely going to bring lots of innovations in immersive graphics, simulation as well as hardware architectures.</p>
