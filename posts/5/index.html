          <p>As people who know me understand, I read articles and listen to podcasts on a variety of topics ranging from technology, social science, society, economics, etc. Economics is one of my favourites, as it is very relatable to our day to day lives, besides involving mathematical modelling (which, for the same reasons as Deep Learning techniques of today, can only be close to a very good approximation but never accurate). While listening to BBC’s Business Daily podcasts, I stumbled upon this episode on Modern Monetary Theory. The title of the podcast - “Magic Money Tree” caught my attention and it turned out to be an interesting take on a proposal by one of the former Hedge Fund manager about central banks being able to print more money when needed. I did have this idea when I was a kid before I realized inflation and value of goods and how they are tied to abundance of ciculation of money, interest rates and consumer spending. I am not an economist but I am worried how this could lead to powerful economies manipulating their inflation thereby leading to disastrous consequences in parts of the world whose currencies are not global trade currencies.</p>

<p>For those interested in listening to the episode, you can do it here:</p>

<p>Are there wonderful teachers among expert economists who can
help me understand?</p>

          <p>We have seen the benefits of deploying technology in many real world applications. Anyone who has used Yelp or IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes before deciding on a restaurant or watching a movie has accepted the indirect aid the (average) ratings on those sites provided about the quality of the restaurant or the movie. Anyone who has watched sports like Cricket, Tennis or Football (soccer) would be able to appreciate the role Hawk-Eye technology plays in resolving decision confusions by on-field referees or umpires. One just wonders how much of technology is used in other adjudications (like lawsuits, for example) and how technology can aid (rather than replace) such adjudications.</p>

<p>Let us take an example of such an adjudication - for example, a dispute between two parties (very much like two teams in a sport) being resolved by an adjudicator (like an on-field referee or an umpire).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In many sports, technology plays a huge role in aiding the on-field umpire or even over-turning the decisions of the on-field umpire when one of the parties was not satisfied with his original decision.</p>

<p>In cricket, this is referred to as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is8Vd_YQKwE">Decision Review System (DRS)</a> - which in turn uses several technologies like Hawk-Eye vision cameras, ball tracking technology and projection and estimation of the movement of the ball beyond the point of obstruction. How do we generalize this for any adjudication process.</p>

<p>Shown below is a general flow of what a simplified process would look like.</p>

<p><strong>Components of a Decision System</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Investigation Facts</strong> These are the facts coming out of an investigation. In sports, these could be coming from several cameras and ball tracking systems. In a civil or criminal lawsuit this could be the facts compiled by a set of investigators.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Acceptable Behaviours</strong> These are the <em>fair</em> rules of the game. In sports, these could be coming from the rule book. In a lawsuit these could be the set of rules acceptable by law (and not necessarily by society).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fact Compiler</strong> is the brain of the system. It compiles the several statements in natural language into unambiguous statements in logic as a first step so that clear interpretation could be made. Then, a comparision of investigation facts against the rules of the game is made to see if all the rules were obeyed or some were not obeyed. The comparision tells us that happened that were actually allowed by the rules of the game (or by law) and what were disallowed by law.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the two parties involved in the dispute can use such a <em>Fact Compiler</em> in order to compile their facts and check what was compromised and what rules were obeyed. There might be rule breaks that one party thinks was the right thing to do and needs an adjudicator to decide taking into account the situation under which the rule break happened (injuring another person during an act of self defence, for example).</p>

<p><strong>Decision Systems</strong>
Now, the decision making system has at least three sets of facts to compare - the compiled facts from each of the two parties involved in the dispute, and the fundamental truth compiled from independent investigation and acceptable (lawful) behaviours. The decision making system can compare these three sets of facts and enumerate the lawful and unlawful behaviours (w.r.t the truth as known to the investigation compared against acceptable legal behaviours). An adjudicator can consult this set of facts in order to avoid his own bias before making an adjudication. Purists might point out that this would not reduce bias as the bias introduced by investigation and fact compiler might indeed propagate to the compiled set of facts, and that is true. The effort to reduce the bias at these stages is to make the Fact Compiler and the input facts less biased by providing “more”, “unbiased” data.</p>

<p><strong>Natural Language Understanding</strong>
While understanding natural language with context is a challenging area of Computer Science and Mathematical logic, this would pave way for an interesting area of research to encode the contexts and use that encoding while building technologies to understand natural language. One of the simplest examples why this is a challenge is to just look at the following pairs of sentences (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_flies_like_an_arrow;_fruit_flies_like_a_banana">inspired by this</a>)and guess an appropriate word for the blank in the second statement:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Time flies like an arrow
Fruit flies like a _______
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most AI systems would not guess the blank as a fruit, let alone one that rhymes with <em>arrow</em> (like <em>mango</em>). The word “like”, though the same word and spelling in both cases, alters the meaning of the statements that pure structural analysis would not help one in completing the second one. We need some semantics and context behind the statements. Another example would be to check if a given statement is a sarcastic one or a serious one. Sarcasm detection, though there are partially successful approaches, is a challenging area for natural language understanding systems.</p>

<p><strong>Automated Reasoning Engines, Logic and Encoding Facts</strong>
Many of the reasoning engines built for reasoning about the correct of computer programs (a set of program statements with a specific syntax (syntax of the programming language), much like the set of facts in English) work on <a href="http://www.manyworldsoflogic.com/predicateLogic.html">predicate logic</a> and there are well known automated solvers to solve a set of facts encoded in this logic. However, encoding contexts and possibilities would involve more than just predicate logic - it might involve modal logic and epistemic logic. A single reasoning engine would do the logical consistency check and derive the consequences (a set of facts) from known facts (provided by the supporting documents) based on encodings of rules of law (the axioms). Once the individual facts from investigations are compiled into precise mathematical statements by the <em>Fact Compiler</em>, rather than ambiguous English statements, the checker can be implemented using technologies behind reasoning engines used in program verification. While research in this area is progressing, it is also important to keep an eye on the applications - like lawsuits as legal statements in English language might require more effort to encode rather than informal statements in English language.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While aiding an adjudicator is an important part of the technology, encoding the facts, at each level of the process, as statements in mathematical logic would allow allow one to play back the compiled judgement (a set of facts) to understand how those facts were arrived at, from the initial sets of facts (like investigations and laws).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be a huge step in explaining the decision made (this would be the cornerstone of an explainable AI system). It would also provide a valuable tool for adjudicators to replay different decisions to check if they would be consistent with the initial sets of facts, or even replay them with some facts removed or altered to explain how the decision would have been different in case one of the parties had done something different (been more lawful instead of breaking the law).</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Most system software is written in C. Besides being one of the oldest programming languages C has arbitrary memory address access and pointer arithmetic that made it attractive for several applications. Further, the memory footprint of C and small runtime made it the preferred language for embedded applications. It is no surprise that most of the software that we encounter in our everyday life has at least some (or in many cases most) part of it written in C.</p>

<p>Overtime, several libraries were developed for C which made programming in C fast and easy. Let us look at a small C function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">copy_data()</code> that uses one such library function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memcpy(dest, src, n)</code> that copies <em>n</em> bytes from a <em>src</em> memory to <em>dest</em> memory area.</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">void copy_data(char *buf, int len)
{
  char tmp[80];
  if (len &gt; sizeof(tmp))        // [A]   
    return -1;
  
  memcpy(tmp, buf, len);        // [B]
  printf("copied data: %s\n", tmp);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our tiny C function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">copy_data</code> has a pointer to a character buffer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buf</code>. We intend to copy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len</code> bytes from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buf</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmp</code>. We call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memcpy(...)</code> function passing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmp</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buf</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len</code>. Looks simple and clean. But is it correct? Think about it.</p>

<p>Although this function looks simple enough to just visually review for correctness, there is a subtle bug. An user of the function could pass a negative value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len</code> and pass the check at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[A]</code>. At <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[B]</code> is where this gets manifested. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memcpy()</code> takes an <em>unsigned int</em> as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len</code> parameter and hence a negative value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len</code> would be interpreted as a huge unsigned value at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[B]</code>, causing the memory beyond <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmp</code> to be overwritten.</p>

          <p>Over the last couple of decades we have come to rely more and more on software. They have occupied more of our lives than any other artifact like television or automobiles (which themselves are beginning to be run more by software). We entrust them with our passwords, bank account numbers, personal details, email gossips, etc. But are they correct? Can they also be imperfect like us humans and consequently harm others that trusted them? We will explore how small and silly bugs in programs can lead to severe consequences. Since most safety critical software is written in C, we will stick to examples using the C programming language. But most of these could be extended to Java (may not be to Rust or other languages though).</p>

<p><strong>Is this program correct?</strong></p>

<p>Below is a simple implementation of Binary Search as found in several text-books, production software, etc. The input parameters are an array <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arr</code> of size <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> and we are interested in searching for a target element <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code> using binary search. If the target element is not found, we will return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-1</code> and if found, we will return the index of the element in the array.</p>

<p>What could go wrong in this program? One can write a bunch of unit tests and it would, most likely, go through fine. And if you think there is some very corner case scenario that is happening here, you are not alone. This bug was undiscovered for decades - we all know binary search algorithm is not something new. When this was discovered, it turned out that not only this binary search algorithm, but many others that involve binary search as a sub-routine was also wrong. <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html">Google’s blogpost on this</a> goes into interesting details and it turns out it also <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6412541">existed in JDK</a>.</p>

<p>The bug is related to arithmetic overflow when computing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mid</code> in:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="n">mid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lo</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">hi</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>A potential fix for this would be to rewrite the above as:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="n">mid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">lo</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">hi</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">lo</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>After all, we should not be trusting our programs as much as we do, before analyzing them.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>On this rainy Sunday in California, with not much motivation to do anything serious, with the last of the India-Australia Test series underway in Sydney delayed due to rain, I started scrolling through the library of my favourite pod-casts and this particular one caught my attention. <em>The Edge Effect</em> - an episode from NPR’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain">Hidden Brain</a> series.</p>

<p>The episode talks about the importance of encouraging and developing diversity of thoughts and ideas. It draws examples from science and music and makes compelling arguments supporting diversity. In particular, the experiments by Adam Galinsky and the life story of Cristina Pato were very impressive.</p>

<p>For those interested, here is a link to the podcast:</p>

</audio>

<p>I should take time to appreciate the diversity my parents exposed me to, while growing up in India.</p>
