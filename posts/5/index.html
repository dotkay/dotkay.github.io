The screens are wide, the hall geometry and <a href="https://www.theaterseatstore.com/blog/movie-sound-systems">sound technologies</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"><em>surrond sound</em></a> add to the experience. It is no surprise that movies like Jurrasic Park, Inception, Avengers, etc. are best watched on large screen, in cinemas. It is not just the story, it is the movie experience, besides the social aspect of being outside and the lights going down. US box office revenues were 11.32 billion USD in 2019 and 11.89 billion USD in 2018 (all time best).</p>

<p>Lately, streaming has become very popular. It gives the convenience of watching the movie as and when one wanted, without having to drive to a cinema and at much lower price. A family of four can watch several movies in their living room for a monthly service fee of about $15, while a movie ticket would cost each of the family members as much. Added to this would be popcorn and soda. Netflix and lately almost every major studio is into streaming. Traditionally, movies were run in cinemas for about 90 days before getting released in digital format. But that 90 day “windowing” is coming under a lot of pressure with many streaming services deciding to release the movies right away in digital format.</p>

<p>So, we have two interesting and opposing forces - cinema halls and streaming services. One provides the best experience while the other provides convenience and affordability. And then came the COVID pandemic. With cinema halls being the sort of place that by design invited a large gathering in an enclosed room, it provided the perfect recipe for a pandemic spread. Cinema halls are closed and people are stuck at home having not much of an entertainment - a perfect recipe for streaming services to be at their best to relieve those sheltering in place of their boredom.</p>

<p>As if the scenario is not interesting enough, it was rumored that a popular movie streaming service - Amazon Prime Video made a bid for a popular cinema chain AMC. Although nothing of this is confirmed, the very thought process in analyzing this is interesting. What would be Amazon’s interest in AMC?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Amazon has a sizeable number of prime customers who get free shipping on goods and some deals on Whole Foods stores. Would Amazon give them monthly passes or subsidized tickets to watch movies in AMC?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amazon Studios makes originals. Would those originals first be released in AMC and later streamed on Amazon Prime?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would Amazon reserve AMC for the first few weeks, for movies with stellar visual and sound effects?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would Amazon split the Studio products into TV shows like soaps for Amazon Prime and movies for AMC?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would AMC become a Hollywood talent scouting arm for Amazon?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In all these, how would the pricing work? Amazon is known for maximizing efficiency and getting the best price for the end customer. Would it be able to replicate it in box office movies? If so, how? It is an interesting aspect waiting to be seen, if the rumours are true and if the deal goes through.</p>

<p>Till then, relax on your couch and stream your favorite shows.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Despite the date of posting, this post isn’t a joke and is meant to provoke some thoughts on efficiency and flexibility.</p>

<p>As a result of COVID-19 pandemic we saw the mad rush for toilet papers and other essentials that were getting swept off super-market shelves. Not just toilet papers, even face-masks and ventilators were in short supply at a time when they were most needed. Many consumer and semiconductor companies lowered their guidance due to disruptions in their supply chain. How did we get into a situation where so many industries - from toilet papers to iPhones were getting affected?</p>

<p>The world over the many years got more globalized. American or Canadian products were not made in the US or Canada. They were made in places where it was cheaper and faster to make. Even <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8">trash is sent to other countries</a> in order to be recycled in a cost-effective manner. In short, global supply chain over the years shaped its goal into one that is more cost efficient rather than being flexible. This is not the first time companies are facing shocks. Not long ago, floods in Japan resulted in supply chain issues for automotive companies.</p>

<p>Is this design for efficiency a problem? It definitely looks like, given what many countries went through as the COVID-19 pandemic stuck. Many companies were not able to reliably source their material and keep their assembly lines busy, as they were over-invested in the most (cost) efficient supply chains like in China. If instead the supply chains were designed for flexibility, the average marginal cost of a product “might be” (and just might be) a little higher but geography specific events would not throw the entire system out of gear. There is an emphasis on the uncertainity of the cost implications as it is not entirely clear at this point. For example, one could argue that, if the semiconductor industry had sourced from several geographies like China, India, Africa, South America, etc., it is very likely that the infrastructure for sustaining such supply chains would have developed in many such countries creating a healthy competition, thereby reducing the cost. And this applies to several industries, not just semiconductors.</p>

<p>Have the corporates learnt a lesson now?. There was a similar talk after supply chain disruptions in Japan, but nothing materialized in the long run. Would this time be different? One has to wait and watch.</p>

          <p>In a <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/03/01/market-returns-and-stocks">previous post</a> we saw how volatile a stock is, compared to a broader market performance, by plotting the percentage change in weekly returns of the stock prices. We were able to visually see that a certain stock was moving much more vigorously than the market (S&amp;P 500 in that case).</p>

<p>In this post, I want to see how to find and measure the movement of a particular stock with respect to the market. Is there a standardized measure? Suppose an investor who holds multiple assets wants to measure how much risk <em>a</em> particular asset adds to his portfolio, is there a way he can quantify the risk?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Statistically, <em>covariance</em> of an asset measures how much the asset moves compared to market movements</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Beta</em> is a standardized measure of this covariance.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        covariance of asset with market 
Beta =  ---------------------------------
            variance of the market
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we have market returns data that we used in our previous plot, we can run a regression on this data and try to fit a straight line to the data points in our dataset. The slope of the regression is the <em>Beta</em>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>R_asset = alpha + beta * R_market
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let us use the <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org">statsmodels</a> library to compute a linear regression.</p>

<p>Since we used (percentage change in ) <em>adjusted closing prices</em> in our returns (with the column name ‘Adj Close’ in our dataframe), we see that the <em>beta</em> of NVIDIA stock during the period of the regression (2015-2019) is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.79</code>. We also see the R-squared value of our regression which turns out to be 0.265 and this indicates that 26.5% of the risk can be attributed to the market risk while the remaining <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">73.5%</code> of the risk is firm specific. We also see the P value of our regression and a bunch of other details.</p>

<p>We can also plot our regression:</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I recently started learning about stock prices, market returns and how risk is measured. I am still in the process of learning about it and I hope to add more to my knowledge in the following months.</p>

<p>There are many stock indices to look for how the general market is performing. More often, we hear about DOW index (DJIA - Dow Jones Industrial Average) down or NASDAQ up and so on. But NASDAQ is a technology firm heavy listing - i.e. the movement of the NASDAQ index would indicate the movement of technology sector to a large extent. While DJIA is a more general mix of stocks, it is price weighted and so companies with a higher stock price or extreme price movements would influence the movement more. Another common index is the S&amp;P 500 (Standard and Poor’s 500) Index. S&amp;P 500 is weighted by market value of the companies rather than the stock prices. So, a 5% movement of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$200</code> stock would affect the index the same way as a 5% movement of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$100</code> stock.</p>

<p>Let us see how the weekly percentage change in returns of one of the stocks (NVDA) compares to the percentage returns of the S&amp;P 500 returns (usually referred to as <em>market returns</em>), over a period of about five years.</p>

<div class="img_container">

</div>

<p>The above plot shows you how much NVDA (NVIDIA stock prices) fluctuate more than the general market (S&amp;P 500 price index). If the stock is too volatile, it might be because of some risk associated with that stock, some portion of which can be explained by market movements and some portion specific to the company’s internal risk. <em>Beta</em> is typically used as a measure of risk, which we will compute in a future post.</p>

          <p>In a <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/02/01/evolution-of-search">previous post</a>, we saw how internet search evolved from being a generic search application to specialized ones. We also saw how there are also apps that provided bundled search experience but by being a gateway (or gatekeeper) to several specialized search services. With search advertising being one of the most lucrative business to be in, there are large implications from the experience, relevance and the quality of the search results.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The search experience and relevance of search results depends on what one is searching for and what extras go with the main search. Searching for a baseball game in a stadium has more likelihood with pizzas or dining places (to grab a bite on your way to the stadium or dine on way back home), while searching for a baseball game on TV goes well with doordash like home delivery or inviting friends over (via a social app). The geographical aspirations and interests that depend on age also matter a lot. Youngsters are more likely to search for fast-food while the elderly might search for baking needs and recipes. Youngsters might search for camping and youth hostels while others would want to visit museums and other historical sites while staying in hotels closer to the city. Youngsters might search for escape rooms while the elderly might look for concerts and plays. Of course, it is not as black and white as described and it is always a large spectrum of interests, age, location and cultural preferences.</p>

<p>Bundled and unbundled search has huge implications on the search advertising. Instead of advertising in one available avenue (a generic search engine), there are specific applications where one could do targeted advertising. I am very likely to search for a restaurant on Yelp, a movie rating on IMDB, books on Amazon, taxi service on Uber, take-away food on Doordash, etc. What this means is that some of the advertising dollars move away from Google to the specialized search apps. Further the data acquired by these specialized search apps may remain separate making them serve more relevant results and improve search experience. That is one of the reasons one searches for restaurant ratings in Yelp and a doormat’s rating on Amazon. While this might make us assume specialized apps might be the only way to go, all-in-one search apps like WeChat (MiniProgram) act as a gatekeeper to many of the services - in many cases the services can be accessed only through WeChat. This might allow such an app to aggregate user preferences from the different services, profile the interests and allow for cross-selling or upselling dynamic advertisements. Such an aggregation of data from the different services (from within an app) also allows to curate advertisements that would target the specific user’s interests. If he has consistently bought pizza take-out every Friday evening, Uber app could advertise pizza take-away stores on the user’s ride back home on Friday evening, and probably suggest some highly rated movies to watch along with eating his pizza. In the absence of such a nexus between the services, there could be other ways of stitching together the different pieces of information (like payment apps, GPS and mapping data, communication apps, etc.) to build a user profile. News feeds further complicate the search, by being more dynamic and real-time and sensitive to user preferences and interests.</p>

<p>This brings us to the discussion of privacy. How does one use the data in such a way that any individual information is not let out, without affecting the quality of the search results. Lately, privacy is a huge concern among technology companies and has hence renewed interest in the topic. Technologies for ensuring privacy without compromising search quality would be a topic of a future post.</p>
