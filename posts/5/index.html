          <p>As people who know me understand, I read articles and listen to podcasts on a variety of topics ranging from technology, social science, society, economics, etc. Economics is one of my favourites, as it is very relatable to our day to day lives, besides involving mathematical modelling (which, for the same reasons as Deep Learning techniques of today, can only be close to a very good approximation but never accurate). While listening to BBC’s Business Daily podcasts, I stumbled upon this episode on Modern Monetary Theory. The title of the podcast - “Magic Money Tree” caught my attention and it turned out to be an interesting take on a proposal by one of the former Hedge Fund manager about central banks being able to print more money when needed. I did have this idea when I was a kid before I realized inflation and value of goods and how they are tied to abundance of ciculation of money, interest rates and consumer spending. I am not an economist but I am worried how this could lead to powerful economies manipulating their inflation thereby leading to disastrous consequences in parts of the world whose currencies are not global trade currencies.</p>

<p>For those interested in listening to the episode, you can do it here:</p>

<p>Are there wonderful teachers among expert economists who can
help me understand?</p>

          <p>We have seen the benefits of deploying technology in many real world applications. Anyone who has used Yelp or IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes before deciding on a restaurant or watching a movie has accepted the indirect aid the (average) ratings on those sites provided about the quality of the restaurant or the movie. Anyone who has watched sports like Cricket, Tennis or Football (soccer) would be able to appreciate the role Hawk-Eye technology plays in resolving decision confusions by on-field referees or umpires. One just wonders how much of technology is used in other adjudications (like lawsuits, for example) and how technology can aid (rather than replace) such adjudications.</p>

<p>Let us take an example of such an adjudication - for example, a dispute between two parties (very much like two teams in a sport) being resolved by an adjudicator (like an on-field referee or an umpire).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In many sports, technology plays a huge role in aiding the on-field umpire or even over-turning the decisions of the on-field umpire when one of the parties was not satisfied with his original decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In cricket, this is referred to as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is8Vd_YQKwE">Decision Review System (DRS)</a> - which in turn uses several technologies like Hawk-Eye vision cameras, ball tracking technology and projection and estimation of the movement of the ball beyond the point of obstruction. How do we generalize this for any adjudication process.</p>

<p>Shown below is a general flow of what a simplified process would look like.</p>

<p><strong>Components of a Decision System</strong></p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">

</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Investigation Facts</strong> These are the facts coming out of an investigation. In sports, these could be coming from several cameras and ball tracking systems. In a civil or criminal lawsuit this could be the facts compiled by a set of investigators.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Acceptable Behaviours</strong> These are the <em>fair</em> rules of the game. In sports, these could be coming from the rule book. In a lawsuit these could be the set of rules acceptable by law (and not necessarily by society).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fact Compiler</strong> is the brain of the system. It compiles the several statements in natural language into unambiguous statements in logic as a first step so that clear interpretation could be made. Then, a comparision of investigation facts against the rules of the game is made to see if all the rules were obeyed or some were not obeyed. The comparision tells us that happened that were actually allowed by the rules of the game (or by law) and what were disallowed by law.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the two parties involved in the dispute can use such a <em>Fact Compiler</em> in order to compile their facts and check what was compromised and what rules were obeyed. There might be rule breaks that one party thinks was the right thing to do and needs an adjudicator to decide taking into account the situation under which the rule break happened (injuring another person during an act of self defence, for example).</p>

<p><strong>Decision Systems</strong>
Now, the decision making system has at least three sets of facts to compare - the compiled facts from each of the two parties involved in the dispute, and the fundamental truth compiled from independent investigation and acceptable (lawful) behaviours. The decision making system can compare these three sets of facts and enumerate the lawful and unlawful behaviours (w.r.t the truth as known to the investigation compared against acceptable legal behaviours). An adjudicator can consult this set of facts in order to avoid his own bias before making an adjudication. Purists might point out that this would not reduce bias as the bias introduced by investigation and fact compiler might indeed propagate to the compiled set of facts, and that is true. The effort to reduce the bias at these stages is to make the Fact Compiler and the input facts less biased by providing “more”, “unbiased” data.</p>

<p><strong>Natural Language Understanding</strong>
While understanding natural language with context is a challenging area of Computer Science and Mathematical logic, this would pave way for an interesting area of research to encode the contexts and use that encoding while building technologies to understand natural language. One of the simplest examples why this is a challenge is to just look at the following pairs of sentences (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_flies_like_an_arrow;_fruit_flies_like_a_banana">inspired by this</a>)and guess an appropriate word for the blank in the second statement:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Time flies like an arrow
Fruit flies like a _______
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most AI systems would not guess the blank as a fruit, let alone one that rhymes with <em>arrow</em> (like <em>mango</em>). The word “like”, though the same word and spelling in both cases, alters the meaning of the statements that pure structural analysis would not help one in completing the second one. We need some semantics and context behind the statements. Another example would be to check if a given statement is a sarcastic one or a serious one. Sarcasm detection, though there are partially successful approaches, is a challenging area for natural language understanding systems.</p>

<p><strong>Automated Reasoning Engines, Logic and Encoding Facts</strong>
Many of the reasoning engines built for reasoning about the correct of computer programs (a set of program statements with a specific syntax (syntax of the programming language), much like the set of facts in English) work on <a href="http://www.manyworldsoflogic.com/predicateLogic.html">predicate logic</a> and there are well known automated solvers to solve a set of facts encoded in this logic. However, encoding contexts and possibilities would involve more than just predicate logic - it might involve modal logic and epistemic logic. A single reasoning engine would do the logical consistency check and derive the consequences (a set of facts) from known facts (provided by the supporting documents) based on encodings of rules of law (the axioms). Once the individual facts from investigations are compiled into precise mathematical statements by the <em>Fact Compiler</em>, rather than ambiguous English statements, the checker can be implemented using technologies behind reasoning engines used in program verification. While research in this area is progressing, it is also important to keep an eye on the applications - like lawsuits as legal statements in English language might require more effort to encode rather than informal statements in English language.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While aiding an adjudicator is an important part of the technology, encoding the facts, at each level of the process, as statements in mathematical logic would allow allow one to play back the compiled judgement (a set of facts) to understand how those facts were arrived at, from the initial sets of facts (like investigations and laws).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be a huge step in explaining the decision made (this would be the cornerstone of an explainable AI system). It would also provide a valuable tool for adjudicators to replay different decisions to check if they would be consistent with the initial sets of facts, or even replay them with some facts removed or altered to explain how the decision would have been different in case one of the parties had done something different (been more lawful instead of breaking the law).</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>In a <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2019/03/09/reinforcement-learning-theory">previous post</a>, we looked at some more terminology in order to dive into Reinforcement Learning (RL). We will see some more key constituents of RL in this one. In particular, we will see how we evaluate states and policies and how actions play a role.</p>

<p>We already saw that states are evaluated using <em>state value function - v(s)</em> that tells us how good a state <em>s</em> is. We also know that our agent can decide to take certain actions to move from one state to another. The agent, ideally, should take the best action - the one that would maximize the value of the states the agent would end up in, by taking the action(s). We talked about an example of taking two actions that correspond to spending $300 in two different ways. Since there could be multiple actions with different probabilities, each action would lead to a different outcome. What determines the actions we take? Are there rules that allow us to decide?</p>

<p>A policy denoted by $\pi$ is a distribution of actions over states, i.e. it denotes the probabilities of different actions given a state <em>s</em>. This completely defines the behavior of the agent. The agent uses a policy to decide what actions to take. Hence in RL, we need to identify the best policy - that would lead us to states with maximum returns. More formally,</p>

\[\pi(a \mid s) = \mathbb{P}[A_t = a \mid S_t = s]\]

<p>Given a policy $\pi$ the transition dynamics defined by our Markov process would take us through a sequence of states that would get us rewards for that policy. Since actions help us transition from one state to another, the overall transition dynamics (it is after all a probabilistic system and each action has a specific probability of being taken) would be the average of all the actions that take us through the different sequences of states. More formally,</p>

\[\mathcal{P}^{\pi}_{s, s'} = \sum_{a \in A} \pi(a \mid s)\mathcal{P}_{s, s'}^{a}\]

<p>The rewards would therefore be,</p>

\[\mathcal{R}_{s}^{\pi} = \sum_{a \in A} \pi(a \mid s)\mathcal{R}^{a}_{s}\]

<p>Given a policy $\pi$, we can encapsulate all the knowledge we need in two functions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>State value function $v_{\pi}(s)$ that denotes <em>how good is it to be in state $s$ following policy $\pi$</em></li>
</ol>

\[v_{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[G_t \mid S_t = s]\]

<ol>
  <li>Action value function $q_{\pi}(s, a)$ that denotes <em>how good is it to take an action $a$ while being in state $s$</em></li>
</ol>

\[q_{\pi}(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[G_t \mid S_t = s, A_t = a]\]

<p>Stepping back from formalizing, let us rething what is our ultimate goal when we program an agent. We want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify what are the best states to be in (with the help of state value function)</li>
  <li>Identify what action to choose whatever state we end up in (with the help of action value function)</li>
</ul>

<p>But we are not just satisfied by knowing how good a state is or even how good an action in a given state is. We want to find the best (optimal) values for state value function and action value functions - denoted by $ v_* (s)$ and $ q_* (s, a)$ over all possible policies. These are governed by two equations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bellman Expectation Equation - that helps us with evaluating states and actions</li>
  <li>Bellman Optimality Equation - that helps us in identifying optimal states and actions</li>
</ol>

<p>The formalisms we came up in this and in the previous post would help us arrive at the above equations.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>In the <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2019/03/03/reinforcement-learning">previous post</a>, we saw the basic concepts and terminology used in <em>Reinforcement Learning</em> (RL). Markov Decision Processes are used to describe the environment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The future is independent of the past given the present</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <em>state</em> is considered Markov if it captures all the relevant information from history. It might have started from initial state and gone through 100 transitions, but one does not need to remember the 100 intermediate states in order to know the system. The current state must somehow capture all of the relevant information. For example, if I say my age is 30 years (state), it fully captures what my age was in each of the last 30 years (state in each year in history). More formally,</p>

\[\mathbb{P}[S_{t+1} \mid S_t] = \mathbb{P}[S_{t+1} \mid S_1, \cdots, S_t]\]

<p>We also talk about state transitions. More often these are probabilistic transitions. If I am a 30 year old engineer (my current state), there is a relatively high probability I can start afresh and learn machine learning from YouTube and become a machine learning engineer (new state) but there is a very low probability that I can start afresh and become as gymnast (new state). Given a current state <em>s</em>, there is a probabilistic transition relation to next state <em>s’</em>. More formally,</p>

\[\mathcal{P}_{ss'} = \mathbb{P}[S_{t+1} = s' \mid S_t = s]\]

<p>A <em>reward</em> is a function on states. That is, given a state <em>s</em> it tells you the expected reward one could accumulate going forward, starting from <em>s</em>. It is the expectation of the rewards you might get at each state going into the future, starting from state <em>s</em>. More formally,</p>

\[\mathcal{R}_s = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} \mid S_t = s]\]

<p>If I am a young graduate student, I might be more focussed on long-term rewards (higher pay later on) at the cost of sacrificing short-term rewards (early employment). If I were a trader in a hedge fund, I might be more focussed on short-term bets (short selling) rather than long-term growth companies. It is fair to say that the reward in each of the above cases has a different rate of growth. One could be myopic and be interested in short-term rewards or one could be long-sighted and wait for long-term rewards. In order to accomodate this, we introduce a discount factor $\gamma \in [0, 1]$, which when close to $0$ indicates interest in short-term rewards and when close to $1$ indicates long-sightedness. The expected total reward, also called <em>return</em> in RL literature is the total discounted reward from a given point in time. More formally,</p>

\[G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+1} + \cdots = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \gamma^{i} R_{t+i+1}\]

<p>How does one evaluate a state <em>s</em>. One needs a metric to compare states to say one state is better than the other. The <em>state value function v(s)</em> gives the long-term value of a state <em>s</em>. Note that it is <em>long-term</em> value, i.e. the value of the state <em>s</em> into the future, if we start from state <em>s</em>. More formally,</p>

\[v(s) = \mathbb{E}[G_t \mid S_t = s]\]

<p>It is the expectation of the returns starting from state <em>s</em>. Since the returns themselves are discounted rewards,</p>

\[v(s) = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} + \gamma v(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t = s]\]

<p>Since are trying to program systems that have agency, the agent can take actions in order to optimize its reward. We also introduce a set of actions and this introduction makes the reward not only a function of a state <em>s</em> but also on the action <em>a</em> that we take while in state <em>s</em>. I could take an action $a_1$ to spend 300 on a Nintendo console or I can take an alternative action $a_2$ of investing 300 in TSLA. These two actions would yield, most likely, very different rewards, starting at the same state (of having 300 to spend). We can rewrite our transition probabilities and rewards by incorporating action.</p>

\[\mathcal{P}_{ss'}^{a} = \mathbb{P}[S_{t+1} = s' \mid S_t = s, A_t = a]\]

<p>and</p>

\[\mathcal{R}_{s}^{a} = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} \mid S_t = s, A_t = a]\]

<p>That was too much of formalism for a post. We will look at more terminologies and formalisms before we dive into some examples to concretize our understanding.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>When we were toddlers, we did not know a lot many things. Slowly, we learnt through our own experiences or the experiences of others around us. We may not have known a gas stove is hot, a container filled to the brim is difficult to carry without spilling, etc. We might still be in the process of learning certain things. Some of these are taught in schools through repetitions and exams in order to get feedback, correct our course and <em>reinforce</em> our knowledge.</p>

<p>Even in everyday activities, we continuously gather feedback and correct our actions. If we start early or start before time, we reach our destination on time. If we study well we get good grades, if we develop unhealthy habits, we have negative effects on our health, and so on. The environment gives us the feedback. The environment includes all other entities apart from us. We can, to some extent, observe the environment but we do not know the full behavior of the environment. We can read weather forecasts before making a trip, but we may not know the predicted rain will cause flash floods, for example.</p>

<p>There are some fundamental concepts and terminologies in <em>reinforcement learning</em> (RL) that makes mapping it to real life experiences easier. An <strong>agent</strong> is someone who has <em>agency</em> - makes decisions and takes actions. In real life, it refers to us - human beings (or our minds). We learn and develop RL algorithms to program an automated system with a physical embodiment (e.g. Robot) or even without it (e.g. just a software API), in which case the agent is the automated system that we are trying to build and make it better using RL. The <strong>environment</strong> is what the agent acts on which is everything beyond us. We do not completely know the environment. We just observe how the environment behaves and calibrate our actions. The environment in turn provides <strong>rewards</strong> which help us learn and calibrate. If we get drenched in rain (negative reward) we may carry an umbrella (action) the next day and try to reduce the negative reward. If we study well (action), we get good grades (positive reward) which would in turn motivate us to study better in order to increase our reward.</p>

<p>The <strong>state</strong> of the system is defined by the valuation of the state variables. If I am a trader in the stock market, my goal is to take actions (buy/sell stocks) in order to increase my reward (profit). My state would be the value of the money I have and a better state would be one in which the value is more (through aggregating profits through a sequence of actions). We talk about sequence of states (i.e. we take action from a state, move to another state, receive reward and take another action, and so on). Our goal is to make sure we reach a state by taking profitable <strong>actions</strong> where the value we obtain, going forward from that state, is maximized.</p>

<p>In future posts, we will formalize many of these concepts and introduce some more.</p>
