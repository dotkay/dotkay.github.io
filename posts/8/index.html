          <p>Keeping up with my modest goals from the <a href="https://dotkay.github.io/2018/08/15/deep-learning-and-tech-products">previous post</a>, I started looking at Google’s product portfolio.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why Google? - Why not?</li>
  <li>Why their product portfolio? - there is such a rich variety catering to different customer segments.</li>
  <li>Why for this topic (analysing how machine learning and/or deep learning will impact/improve the products)? - Because we already see the impact (like Google translate, maps, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s their product portfolio, right from their webpage:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">
  <p><img src="/assets/images/products/G_product_portfolio.png" alt="Google Product Portfolio" class="img=responsive" /></p>
</div>

<p>In future posts, we will pick products from this list and analyze.</p>

          <p>I happened to complete an online course on Deep Learning and just starting to look at different products to see how machine learning or deep learning techniques could be used to make these products better. Since I understand technology products and their landscape better, I am likely to be biased in analysing more technology products than non-tech ones, although I am determined to study some non-tech industries, processes, products and services to see if (at all) and how deep learning could be used there - that is a bigger challenge and one that would stimulate our neurons more. Let’s see how I fare …</p>

          <p>While driving back from a camping along with my friends and looking at the vast possibly burnt areas, we started thinking why even in the <em>so called</em> hot bed of technology (Silicon Valley) we <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/30/why-planes-cant-fight-shastas-deadly-carr-fire/">hear</a> that fire fighting aircrafts had visibility problems because of the dense smoke. Why can’t we use autonomous drone technology for fighting wild fires (given that we use unmanned drones for warfare). Something to think about seriously.</p>

          <p>Allez les Bleus!!</p>

<p>Just happened to listen to this week’s episode of one of the recent NPR podcast series titled <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain">Hidden Brain</a> and it got me thinking a lot. I speak almost 5 languages (not fluently but to different degrees of expertise) and I am not sure how my mind thinks. One thing for sure though is that I happen to think in my mother tongue and my mind translates it in (almost) real-time while I communicate, be it talking or writing down my thoughts as I do while writing this blog post. If languages do influence our thinking and understanding and more importantly the biases we cultivate, what does it mean for language translators - do they also convey the biases that are inherently influenced by one’s language? Or as a technologist I am also inclined to think what would it mean for AI systems (say chat-bots) that are meant to facilitate communication? I now tend to believe that they have to be designed with the intricacies of languages and the influences, biases that it carries along encoded into the system in order for it to be more acceptable. Even if not as a chat-bot, it would be a great system to train people to work with people of different cultures so that we understand different cultures better and comfortably communicate taking into account their nuances.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Suppose you own a few small boats and are making money shipping goods between UK and continental Europe. Your boats are small and they have limited capacity. You have your busy days once in a while but almost always you need to choose the products so that you can create maximum value. Your fee is not based on the weight of the products rather on the value of the products that you ship.</p>

<p>Brexit vote happened and all of a sudden you get requests for shipping products that you have never shipped before. You are not sure how to decide which products to ship. Given a bunch of products like fish, cheese, expensive wine, Louis Vuitton bags, etc. along with their weight and their value, you want to decide how many of each item to include in order to get maximum value. Remember that you have small boats which have limited carrying capacity.</p>

<p>Several years ago, you got a CS degree and you think it might come to use now. You decide to write a program in order to figure out maximum value that you could obtain. All good. You pick up your chromebook and start framing the problem. You have a list of items - their weights and values. You know the capacity of your boat (you do it for one boat at a time, as if one boat is in France, one is in UK and the third is in Amsterdam).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a list w: weights of items
a list v: corresponding value of the items
threshold: capacity of your boat
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now, you can include the item to be carried in your boat or exclude it and tell the merchant to wait for the next trip or find another shipping agency. For an item <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, once you decide to include it, your value would increase by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v[i]</code> and you will have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">threshold - w[i]</code> capacity left in your boat. If you decide to exclude item <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, you will have no value from that item (as you are not transporting it) but you will have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">threshold</code> capacity to fill. It should be an easy problem then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>for each of the items, you find the max value from the two choices you have: including an item <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> or excluding the item <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is as simple as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max(incl, excl)</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">incl</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">excl</code> refer to the value you obtain by deciding to include the item <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> or exclude the item <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>. Once you include the item <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, you would be left with one less item in your candidate set to pick the next one. Intuitively you can keep recursing until there are no more items left or until your threshold is reached. You go about writing a recursive algorithm to help you decide.</p>
