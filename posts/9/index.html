        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Over the last couple of decades we have come to rely more and more on software. They have occupied more of our lives than any other artifact like television or automobiles (which themselves are beginning to be run more by software). We entrust them with our passwords, bank account numbers, personal details, email gossips, etc. But are they correct? Can they also be imperfect like us humans and consequently harm others that trusted them? We will explore how small and silly bugs in programs can lead to severe consequences. Since most safety critical software is written in C, we will stick to examples using the C programming language. But most of these could be extended to Java (may not be to Rust or other languages though).</p>

<p><strong>Is this program correct?</strong></p>

<p>Below is a simple implementation of Binary Search as found in several text-books, production software, etc. The input parameters are an array <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arr</code> of size <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> and we are interested in searching for a target element <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code> using binary search. If the target element is not found, we will return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-1</code> and if found, we will return the index of the element in the array.</p>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>What could go wrong in this program? One can write a bunch of unit tests and it would, most likely, go through fine. And if you think there is some very corner case scenario that is happening here, you are not alone. This bug was undiscovered for decades - we all know binary search algorithm is not something new. When this was discovered, it turned out that not only this binary search algorithm, but many others that involve binary search as a sub-routine was also wrong. <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html">Google’s blogpost on this</a> goes into interesting details and it turns out it also <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6412541">existed in JDK</a>.</p>

<p>The bug is related to arithmetic overflow when computing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mid</code> in:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="n">mid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lo</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">hi</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>A potential fix for this would be to rewrite the above as:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="n">mid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">lo</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">hi</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">lo</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>After all, we should not be trusting our programs as much as we do, before analyzing them.</p>

          <p>On this rainy Sunday in California, with not much motivation to do anything serious, with the last of the India-Australia Test series underway in Sydney delayed due to rain, I started scrolling through the library of my favourite pod-casts and this particular one caught my attention. <em>The Edge Effect</em> - an episode from NPR’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain">Hidden Brain</a> series.</p>

<p>The episode talks about the importance of encouraging and developing diversity of thoughts and ideas. It draws examples from science and music and makes compelling arguments supporting diversity. In particular, the experiments by Adam Galinsky and the life story of Cristina Pato were very impressive.</p>

<p>For those interested, here is a link to the podcast:</p>

</audio>

<p>I should take time to appreciate the diversity my parents exposed me to, while growing up in India.</p>

<p>I got into this discussion over lunch when I heard about the Netflix series “Black Mirror” which allows the audience to choose among a set of possible story endings. This is an excellent development, in my view, in that it not only brings more suspense and interest or attention to the content, on the lighter side it would also prevent spoilers.</p>

<p>Ever since I heard about <a href="https://newsable.asianetnews.com/kerala/after-solo-other-malayalam-films-supposed-to-have-different-endings">south Indian movies that had different climaxes</a> (although to appease the fan base in different regions), I have always wondered why not have multiple possibilities for a movie climax and serve (stream) the appropriate one depending on the goal of the movie audience - i.e., if the goal is to just watch the movie and return home happy, one could have a happy ending, if the viewer is adventurous or an FPS gamer, one could have a violent or tragic ending, etc.</p>

<p>Now that we have personalization using big data analytics everywhere, it should be possible for a streaming service to identify the likes and dislikes of the audience based on previous perferences, reviews, age, likes, and the many similar features to identify the best climax for each specific viewer, besides providing the viewer the choice to choose from alternate climaxes. Of course, the cost is in the making of several different versions of a movie or TV series which in a way could be reduced using today’s CGI that only gets better over time. The upshot would be more viewership and more discussion centered around the various climaxes. Instead of viewers just watching the movie and rating them, each different climax of the same movie would get rated by different personalities. Such a service could also stream a movie ending in such a way as to cheer you up when you are dull or to pump you up when you are demotivated. Movies will never be the same again!</p>

<p>If such a personalization of streaming content were to happen who would lead the way? Would it be Amazon Fire TV who has the machine learning backend to make personalization happen, NetFlix who has the influence to get the producers to make several interesting versions of a movie or TV series or Apple TV service if Apple were to get its innovation crown back? What do you think?</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Happy New year friends!</p>

<p>What a year 2018 has been for the topic of privacy and security - from the most loved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html">social network</a> scrambling for clues to save themselves to the other <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/10/google-to-shut-down-early-after-privacy-flaw-affects-over-50m-users">social network</a> built by the world’s best engineers still couldn’t save their data, besides struggling to stay relevant. While Europe was quick to pass <a href="https://eugdpr.org/">GDPR</a>, many other countries even in the developed world are yet to catch up with such laws and regulations. 2018 was also the year that saw the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/28/smart-speakers-hit-critical-mass-in-2018/">surge in smart speakers</a> and home automation - isn’t that ironic?</p>

<p>But this story is not about the past, but about the future. Many top technology and auto companies rushing to fulfill the promise of self-driving or autonomous vehicles. It will definitely become a reality, to some extent, in at least the parts of the world where the infrastructure supports it. But the notion of foolproof security for such a technology is far from being achieved. With smartphone apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Google+ security issues, we have only scratched the surface of the malevolent intent that is possible. Once autonomous vehicles and other IoT devices reach critical mass, the security issues are only going to multiply manifold and the impact of security flaws can have disastrous consequences. Imagine a malicious attacker taking control of traffic lights that talk to cars or cars talking to other cars to negotiate who gets to cross an intersection, or a mass rapid transit system that reroutes itself or changes frequency of rides depending on real-time ridership information using neural network based predictions. Imagine the impact of such a thing gone wrong. With the current day deep learning algorithms themselves not being tractable (i.e. one can not reliably track the computation from input data to the prediction step by step as in <a href="https://skymind.ai/wiki/symbolic-reasoning">symbolic AI</a>) it is going to be more challenging to resolve a security issue even after having identified it. Apologies for being pessimistic - but one should see this as a challenge for computer architecture and computer security research - a great time to be working in any of these fields.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want a job for the next one year, learn web/mobile app development, if you need a job for the next five years, train yourself with deep learning skills, if you need a job for the rest of your life, start working on computer security.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Suppose you are the tech-savvy engineer recruited by Public Works Department in your rural county. The rural county has wonderful flora, fauna and a few environmentalists and ecologists have been recruited to take care of the environment. There are a few houses built to host these people. Since the settlement is very new, the county has asked you to design a efficient water connection map to bring water to these settlements from a water source at one corner of the area. There are known paths where these water pipelines could be laid in a way that will have minimal effect on the environment. And you have been entrusted with using some of these paths in such a way as to minimise the cost and at the same time make sure every house gets a water connection.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="img_container">

</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>You sit down and think that the map is nothing but an implicit graph, the cost of laying the pipelines being the weights on the graph’s edges. The vertices are the houses. You have one special vertex which is the community’s source of water. Your plan is to find the path from the source of water to every house in the community. Further, there might be several such paths and you would have to choose the one that has the lowest cost. You recall algorithms for minimum spanning trees that you had learned in your algorithms lessons a decade ago and decide to give it a go.</p>

<p>Algorithmically, you have a set of edges with weights, a set of vertices and a special start vertex. Suppose each edge is defined by a source vertex <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code>, a destination vertex <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dest</code> and the associated cost of laying the pipe between these vertices <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cost</code> - represented by the following structure:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">Edge</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">src</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">dest</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">cost</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>And our graph is defined by the total set of vertices <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">V</code> (one source of water + the nodes representing houses) and a vector of Edges <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EdgeList</code> each element is an Edge as defined above.</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="n">Graph</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">V</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">vector</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Edge</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">edges</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Assume that we also have a UnionFind data structure for us to use. Since we have to minimize the cost of construction, we try a greedy approach by picking the least expensive pipelines first - i.e., we sort <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">edges</code> in increasing order of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cost</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">EdgeList</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">begin</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">EdgeList</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">end</span><span class="p">(),</span> 
          <span class="p">[](</span><span class="n">Edge</span> <span class="n">e1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Edge</span> <span class="n">e2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">e1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">cost</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">e2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">cost</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">});</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Once we pick the least cost edge, the next least cost edge may not be a neighbour of the current edge (i.e. having a common <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dest</code> vertex). In order to prevent cycles, we maintain a UnionFind data structure and keep adding the (minimum cost) edges we choose. As we collect the minimum cost edges, we can compute the cost using an accumulator.</p>
