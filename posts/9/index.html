        <div class="post-content">
          <p>When we were toddlers, we did not know a lot many things. Slowly, we learnt through our own experiences or the experiences of others around us. We may not have known a gas stove is hot, a container filled to the brim is difficult to carry without spilling, etc. We might still be in the process of learning certain things. Some of these are taught in schools through repetitions and exams in order to get feedback, correct our course and <em>reinforce</em> our knowledge.</p>

<p>Even in everyday activities, we continuously gather feedback and correct our actions. If we start early or start before time, we reach our destination on time. If we study well we get good grades, if we develop unhealthy habits, we have negative effects on our health, and so on. The environment gives us the feedback. The environment includes all other entities apart from us. We can, to some extent, observe the environment but we do not know the full behavior of the environment. We can read weather forecasts before making a trip, but we may not know the predicted rain will cause flash floods, for example.</p>

<p>There are some fundamental concepts and terminologies in <em>reinforcement learning</em> (RL) that makes mapping it to real life experiences easier. An <strong>agent</strong> is someone who has <em>agency</em> - makes decisions and takes actions. In real life, it refers to us - human beings (or our minds). We learn and develop RL algorithms to program an automated system with a physical embodiment (e.g. Robot) or even without it (e.g. just a software API), in which case the agent is the automated system that we are trying to build and make it better using RL. The <strong>environment</strong> is what the agent acts on which is everything beyond us. We do not completely know the environment. We just observe how the environment behaves and calibrate our actions. The environment in turn provides <strong>rewards</strong> which help us learn and calibrate. If we get drenched in rain (negative reward) we may carry an umbrella (action) the next day and try to reduce the negative reward. If we study well (action), we get good grades (positive reward) which would in turn motivate us to study better in order to increase our reward.</p>

</div>

<p>The <strong>state</strong> of the system is defined by the valuation of the state variables. If I am a trader in the stock market, my goal is to take actions (buy/sell stocks) in order to increase my reward (profit). My state would be the value of the money I have and a better state would be one in which the value is more (through aggregating profits through a sequence of actions). We talk about sequence of states (i.e. we take action from a state, move to another state, receive reward and take another action, and so on). Our goal is to make sure we reach a state by taking profitable <strong>actions</strong> where the value we obtain, going forward from that state, is maximized.</p>

<p>In future posts, we will formalize many of these concepts and introduce some more.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Most system software is written in C. Besides being one of the oldest programming languages C has arbitrary memory address access and pointer arithmetic that made it attractive for several applications. Further, the memory footprint of C and small runtime made it the preferred language for embedded applications. It is no surprise that most of the software that we encounter in our everyday life has at least some (or in many cases most) part of it written in C.</p>

<p>Overtime, several libraries were developed for C which made programming in C fast and easy. Let us look at a small C function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">copy_data()</code> that uses one such library function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memcpy(dest, src, n)</code> that copies <em>n</em> bytes from a <em>src</em> memory to <em>dest</em> memory area.</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">void copy_data(char *buf, int len)
{
  char tmp[80];
  if (len &gt; sizeof(tmp))        // [A]   
    return -1;
  
  memcpy(tmp, buf, len);        // [B]
  printf("copied data: %s\n", tmp);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our tiny C function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">copy_data</code> has a pointer to a character buffer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buf</code>. We intend to copy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len</code> bytes from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buf</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmp</code>. We call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memcpy(...)</code> function passing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmp</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buf</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len</code>. Looks simple and clean. But is it correct? Think about it.</p>

<p>Although this function looks simple enough to just visually review for correctness, there is a subtle bug. An user of the function could pass a negative value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len</code> and pass the check at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[A]</code>. At <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[B]</code> is where this gets manifested. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memcpy()</code> takes an <em>unsigned int</em> as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len</code> parameter and hence a negative value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len</code> would be interpreted as a huge unsigned value at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[B]</code>, causing the memory beyond <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmp</code> to be overwritten.</p>

          <p>Over the last couple of decades we have come to rely more and more on software. They have occupied more of our lives than any other artifact like television or automobiles (which themselves are beginning to be run more by software). We entrust them with our passwords, bank account numbers, personal details, email gossips, etc. But are they correct? Can they also be imperfect like us humans and consequently harm others that trusted them? We will explore how small and silly bugs in programs can lead to severe consequences. Since most safety critical software is written in C, we will stick to examples using the C programming language. But most of these could be extended to Java (may not be to Rust or other languages though).</p>

<p><strong>Is this program correct?</strong></p>

<p>Below is a simple implementation of Binary Search as found in several text-books, production software, etc. The input parameters are an array <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arr</code> of size <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> and we are interested in searching for a target element <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code> using binary search. If the target element is not found, we will return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-1</code> and if found, we will return the index of the element in the array.</p>

<p>What could go wrong in this program? One can write a bunch of unit tests and it would, most likely, go through fine. And if you think there is some very corner case scenario that is happening here, you are not alone. This bug was undiscovered for decades - we all know binary search algorithm is not something new. When this was discovered, it turned out that not only this binary search algorithm, but many others that involve binary search as a sub-routine was also wrong. <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html">Google’s blogpost on this</a> goes into interesting details and it turns out it also <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6412541">existed in JDK</a>.</p>

<p>The bug is related to arithmetic overflow when computing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mid</code> in:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="n">mid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lo</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">hi</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>A potential fix for this would be to rewrite the above as:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="n">mid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">lo</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">hi</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">lo</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>After all, we should not be trusting our programs as much as we do, before analyzing them.</p>

          <p>On this rainy Sunday in California, with not much motivation to do anything serious, with the last of the India-Australia Test series underway in Sydney delayed due to rain, I started scrolling through the library of my favourite pod-casts and this particular one caught my attention. <em>The Edge Effect</em> - an episode from NPR’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain">Hidden Brain</a> series.</p>

<p>The episode talks about the importance of encouraging and developing diversity of thoughts and ideas. It draws examples from science and music and makes compelling arguments supporting diversity. In particular, the experiments by Adam Galinsky and the life story of Cristina Pato were very impressive.</p>

<p>For those interested, here is a link to the podcast:</p>

<p>I should take time to appreciate the diversity my parents exposed me to, while growing up in India.</p>

<p>I got into this discussion over lunch when I heard about the Netflix series “Black Mirror” which allows the audience to choose among a set of possible story endings. This is an excellent development, in my view, in that it not only brings more suspense and interest or attention to the content, on the lighter side it would also prevent spoilers.</p>

<p>Ever since I heard about <a href="https://newsable.asianetnews.com/kerala/after-solo-other-malayalam-films-supposed-to-have-different-endings">south Indian movies that had different climaxes</a> (although to appease the fan base in different regions), I have always wondered why not have multiple possibilities for a movie climax and serve (stream) the appropriate one depending on the goal of the movie audience - i.e., if the goal is to just watch the movie and return home happy, one could have a happy ending, if the viewer is adventurous or an FPS gamer, one could have a violent or tragic ending, etc.</p>

<p>Now that we have personalization using big data analytics everywhere, it should be possible for a streaming service to identify the likes and dislikes of the audience based on previous perferences, reviews, age, likes, and the many similar features to identify the best climax for each specific viewer, besides providing the viewer the choice to choose from alternate climaxes. Of course, the cost is in the making of several different versions of a movie or TV series which in a way could be reduced using today’s CGI that only gets better over time. The upshot would be more viewership and more discussion centered around the various climaxes. Instead of viewers just watching the movie and rating them, each different climax of the same movie would get rated by different personalities. Such a service could also stream a movie ending in such a way as to cheer you up when you are dull or to pump you up when you are demotivated. Movies will never be the same again!</p>

<p>If such a personalization of streaming content were to happen who would lead the way? Would it be Amazon Fire TV who has the machine learning backend to make personalization happen, NetFlix who has the influence to get the producers to make several interesting versions of a movie or TV series or Apple TV service if Apple were to get its innovation crown back? What do you think?</p>
