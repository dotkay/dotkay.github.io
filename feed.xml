      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2021/02/21/us-unemployment/">&lt;p&gt;With 2020 being one of the worst in recent history, for many reasons fuelled by the pandemic. With many countries being unprepared to handle a pandemic of this size, it also exposed the global supply chain being &lt;a href=&quot;https://dotkay.github.io/2020/04/01/efficiency-vs-flexibility&quot;&gt;highly optimized rather than flexible&lt;/a&gt;. It also exposed the inequality in society - healthcare, job security, income, etc. Many countries had to start manufacturing personal protective equipments (PPE), ventilators, etc. by themselves to serve the local needs rather than rely on the supply chain that got stalled. A couple of decades ago, many of these equipments were manufactured locally but over time, many of those got offshored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this post is not about unemployment due to the pandemic. It is more about loss of U.S. jobs over the period 2001-2017, mostly due to trade deficits, with data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epi.org/publication/the-china-toll-deepens-growth-in-the-bilateral-trade-deficit-between-2001-and-2017-cost-3-4-million-u-s-jobs-with-losses-in-every-state-and-congressional-district/&quot;&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; and manufacturing data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/employment-levels-by-industry.htm&quot;&gt;BLS data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first decade of the century was the worst for U.S. manufacturing jobs. It saw the steepest decline in such jobs, in a very long time. There are two conflicting theories around this - one argues the loss is due to increased automation, while the other attributes the loss to offshoring of such jobs. I could not find the data on rate of automation or increase in manufacturing jobs in other geographies during the time period in order to analyze it analytically. However the loss of jobs, whatever being the root cause, is itself staggering.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'simple_white'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;700&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;700&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe id=&quot;igraph&quot; scrolling=&quot;yes&quot; style=&quot;border:none;&quot; seamless=&quot;seamless&quot; src=&quot;https://plotly.com/~kkplot/6.embed&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, about four decades ago the Bay Area in California was full of orange orchards, and a couple of decades later they all became startups working in electronics and software (Silicon Valley). They were not startups making apps that let teenagers poke and swipe at each other but advanced electronics and software that goes along with it, like routers, modems, semiconductor chips, etc. There were supposedly many small enterprises manufacturing circuit boards and assembling systems for these famous companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An old video of Macintosh Factory in Fremont:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dk306ZkNOuc&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But does it mean only the electronics jobs got offshored? Not really. If we look at the data deeper and look at the number of jobs lost state-wise, it gives a more detailed picture. Almost every major state in the U.S. has lost thousands of jobs from 2001-2017, with most of the loss happening between 2001-2009. Many other states would have seen loss of jobs in other industries like automobiles and steel included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'State'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Jobs Lost'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'% Jobs Lost'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Jobs Lost'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Jobs Lost (in thousands)'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe id=&quot;igraph&quot; scrolling=&quot;yes&quot; style=&quot;border:none;&quot; seamless=&quot;seamless&quot; src=&quot;https://plotly.com/~kkplot/1.embed&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; width=&quot;980&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look even deeper into the data, we can see how many jobs were lost in each state’s congressional districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Total Jobs'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'State'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'% Jobs Lost'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'State'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'States and Congressional Districts'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hover_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Congressional District'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe id=&quot;igraph&quot; scrolling=&quot;yes&quot; style=&quot;border:none;&quot; seamless=&quot;seamless&quot; src=&quot;https://plotly.com/~kkplot/4.embed&quot; height=&quot;870&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I find reliable data on rate of automation and manufacturing jobs gained in other geographies, analysis of that data would help in putting the pieces together. While I am not against offshoring, I am all for a more flexible supply chain, rather than a super-optimized supply chain that would get disrupted affecting the lives and livelihoods of several people, as we witnessed last year when medical devices and PPE supply chain got disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many jobs have been offshored causing large scale unemployment, there is still hope for reskilling of workers and creating new jobs that would drive the economy the next two decades - like solar panels, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dotkay.github.io/2020/09/13/electric-batteries&quot;&gt;electric batteries&lt;/a&gt;, recycling of batteries, advanced technologies for water, air purification, education and healthcare, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="https://dotkay.github.io/2021/01/19/gme-wall-street/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Is it GameStop vs Hedge Funds or GameStop vs Streaming?" />
      <published>2021-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2021-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2021/01/19/gme-wall-street</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2021/01/19/gme-wall-street/">&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows GameStop now, and its ticker symbol too - gamers, non-gamers, traders, non-traders, all alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GameStop is a chain of retail stores that sells game merchandise, equipment and at one point (when games were sold on CDs) games. Retail is moving online and if the product is software, it has already moved. I can’t recollect the last time I saw Windows OS or Office sold in a CD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds apparently make money by betting on such companies - borrow money or company shares from some lender promising to repay and in the mean time, bet on the downside of the company, wait for the price to crash, buy the stock (for cheap) and give it back to the lender (pocketing the difference). I am not sure how they pick companies to bet on. However, late last year and early January, GameStop was the candidate. In order to revolt againt this, some online enthusiasts mobilized themselves to buy options on this stock, thereby increasing the stock price (‘stock price’ not ‘company value’) that would hurt the Hedge funds’ intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us look at some data to see if Hedge funds are the real detterants to GameStop’s future or if there are other factors - like streaming. It was not just GameStop (GME), but also Nokia (NOK), AMC and Blackberry (BB) that went through this early January, but GameStop had the biggest change. Just to show the trend in these stocks (GameStop removed from the plot below as the change in GME was too high that the other trends wouldn’t show up well). Notice how the overall trend in stock prices have been over the last few years and how it changed towards the end of 2020 and early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to see what (game) streaming industry is like, I started looking for data on this - number of subscribers, streamers, etc. I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitchtracker.com/statistics&quot;&gt;Twitchtracker&lt;/a&gt; that tracks statistics on Twitch. Since Twitch’s data was easiest to get and well organized, I decided to look at just Twitch data (number of concurrent viewers) and plot it alongside GameStop stock price over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Everyone knows GameStop now, and its ticker symbol too - gamers, non-gamers, traders, non-traders, all alike. GameStop is a chain of retail stores that sells game merchandise, equipment and at one point (when games were sold on CDs) games. Retail is moving online and if the product is software, it has already moved. I can’t recollect the last time I saw Windows OS or Office sold in a CD. Hedge funds apparently make money by betting on such companies - borrow money or company shares from some lender promising to repay and in the mean time, bet on the downside of the company, wait for the price to crash, buy the stock (for cheap) and give it back to the lender (pocketing the difference). I am not sure how they pick companies to bet on. However, late last year and early January, GameStop was the candidate. In order to revolt againt this, some online enthusiasts mobilized themselves to buy options on this stock, thereby increasing the stock price (‘stock price’ not ‘company value’) that would hurt the Hedge funds’ intentions. Let us look at some data to see if Hedge funds are the real detterants to GameStop’s future or if there are other factors - like streaming. It was not just GameStop (GME), but also Nokia (NOK), AMC and Blackberry (BB) that went through this early January, but GameStop had the biggest change. Just to show the trend in these stocks (GameStop removed from the plot below as the change in GME was too high that the other trends wouldn’t show up well). Notice how the overall trend in stock prices have been over the last few years and how it changed towards the end of 2020 and early 2021. ... plt.plot(amc_df['Date'], amc_df['Adj Close'], label='AMC') plt.plot(nok_df['Date'], nok_df['Adj Close'], label='NOK') plt.plot(bb_df['Date'], bb_df['Adj Close'], label='BB') plt.plot() ...

      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2020/10/10/sense-of-self</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/10/10/sense-of-self/">&lt;p&gt;We perceive our sense of self as an amalgamation of the different sensory inputs - visual, tactile, locomotive, etc., that our brain processes and interprets. Or in other words, our sense of self is an interpretation made for us by our brain (mind) after processing several inputs. In olden days philosophers who tried to understand one’s true self found it difficult to reason about the interpretation of sense of self - are we really who we are? or are we manifestations of our mind’s interpretation of several inputs? This is a fascinating topic and lately neuroscience research is trying to understand which parts of the brain are processing and how our brain creates such interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Wasnt-There-Investigations/dp/0525954198&quot;&gt;The Man Who Wasn’t There&lt;/a&gt;, journalist Anil Ananthaswamy takes us through the neuroscience research on this topic. The main message of this book is that our sense of self is an interpretation of several inputs which are beyond just sensory inputs but our own physical body and society play a vital role. And in this age where Computer Scientists are working on Deep Learning as well as trying to understand the neurological pathways in order to build systems that mimic the human decision making apparatus, while that apparatus itself is not completely understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What fascinates me about this study is how the mind’s computation of sense of self can be influenced (or cheated) by changing the mapping (think of it as lookup table entries) the mind preserves for different sensory and other inputs. In many cases, what we feel and believe our sense of self is, is just an interpretation (an entry in the table) that is fetched given the inputs. We can influence such inputs to pick up a different entry that would alter our sense of self. There is also a classic neuroscience experiment from the 90s that demonstrates how the mapping in our brain, representing our physical sense of self, can be altered within minutes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am intrigued about the possibility of changing our emotional sense of self and if it could be done non-invasively using technology. Such a possibility would be a big boost to curing several mental disorders just by altering the mapping in the mind, when we know how the mapping is created, where it is stored and how it is interpreted. Also, one needs to be aware of ramifications of this - can such mappings be altered by say adversarial inputs - visual or societal - in the form of social media posts or news articles. We might be destroying our own sense of self by letting our mind interpret the inputs that we consume, without us realizing the end result - thinking we are who our mind interprets (influenced interpretation/self) rather than who we really are (actual self).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <summary type="html">We perceive our sense of self as an amalgamation of the different sensory inputs - visual, tactile, locomotive, etc., that our brain processes and interprets. Or in other words, our sense of self is an interpretation made for us by our brain (mind) after processing several inputs. In olden days philosophers who tried to understand one’s true self found it difficult to reason about the interpretation of sense of self - are we really who we are? or are we manifestations of our mind’s interpretation of several inputs? This is a fascinating topic and lately neuroscience research is trying to understand which parts of the brain are processing and how our brain creates such interpretations. In his book, The Man Who Wasn’t There, journalist Anil Ananthaswamy takes us through the neuroscience research on this topic. The main message of this book is that our sense of self is an interpretation of several inputs which are beyond just sensory inputs but our own physical body and society play a vital role. And in this age where Computer Scientists are working on Deep Learning as well as trying to understand the neurological pathways in order to build systems that mimic the human decision making apparatus, while that apparatus itself is not completely understood. What fascinates me about this study is how the mind’s computation of sense of self can be influenced (or cheated) by changing the mapping (think of it as lookup table entries) the mind preserves for different sensory and other inputs. In many cases, what we feel and believe our sense of self is, is just an interpretation (an entry in the table) that is fetched given the inputs. We can influence such inputs to pick up a different entry that would alter our sense of self. There is also a classic neuroscience experiment from the 90s that demonstrates how the mapping in our brain, representing our physical sense of self, can be altered within minutes. You can take a look at an example experiment below: I am intrigued about the possibility of changing our emotional sense of self and if it could be done non-invasively using technology.

      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2020/09/13/electric-batteries</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/09/13/electric-batteries/">&lt;p&gt;One of the many issues the global pandemic has exposed is the (mostly) single point of failure in global supply chain systems. Over the last couple of decades global corporations optimized their supply chain to such an extent that it became far from flexible, while being extremely optimized. While the supply chain disruptions in today’s products - from face masks to medical equipments got exposed, this post is about the future supply chain challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many countries rallying towards fighting climate change, electric vehicles are at the forefront of that fight. With the cost per kilowatt-hour touching $100/kWhr or even less, electric vehicles would not only make economic sense but also reduce the total cost of ownership drastically. While American companies like Tesla are at the head of the pack in innovation and execution, the components for uninterrupted production as well as security lie elsewhere - the supply chain for electric car batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Benchmark’s Simon Mores says there are two ways of reducing cost of Li-ion batteries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Controlling the supply of raw materials that go into batteries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changing how batteries are made (scale)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the prices of raw materials were at all time high, companies like Tesla maintain lead by controlling the manufacturing process - “the scale” as 25-40% of the cost of an electric vehicle can be attributed to the cost of the battery. That is where Gigafactories become interesting and so does controlling the supply chain. But so far, American auto companies, to a large extent, have only been assembling the components that constitute the battery. There is a lot of effort that goes into a battery before this final assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us break this apart looking at the value chain of electric battery manufacturing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/tmp/main/misc/ev_bat_value_chain.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one were to superimpose the geographies that control different parts of the value chain, one could immediately see the premonitions of future supply chain challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/tmp/main/misc/ev_bat_value_chain_geo.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 50% of every one of the raw materials is dependent on one geography, which is a recipe for future disruptions. As Benchmark’s Vivas Kumar points out, the only part of the value chain that can’t be moved around are the mines themselves. Every other part of the value chain can be located in different parts of the globe. Most of the early stages of the value chain like Cathode, cell manufacturing, etc. are controlled predominantly by specific geographies that would be a supply chain and security risk when electric vehicles become like mobile phones. A wise thing for such an industry like Auto to do is to shore up the different components so that the critical component (battery) supply is not disrupted in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One has to wait and see if the electric battery supply chain gets reshored and does not become another disruption waiting to happen or if short term optimization goals will lead to long-term disasters, just as it is happening in semiconductors and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2020/07/01/online-education-part-2</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/07/01/online-education-part-2/">&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dotkay.github.io/2020/05/25/online-education-part-1&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; we saw the challenges in accessing quality education digitally. In this post, we will look at some of the disparate pieces of technology that could work together to make online education less expensive, more efficient and hopefully more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a 45000 ft. view, online education is just about a video playing in a TV or a computer browser, much like any TV program or YouTube or Vimeo video would. But there is a lot more to it as you go down into the details. Even in its simplest form (i.e. no authentication, account validation, etc.,) most of them contain video and audio streams, which itself is the first bottleneck for places which have poor internet bandwidths, if at all internet exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the very first technical problem is to address bandwidth the way several streaming services address them - by encoding them in different qualities and formats, cache them in CDNs or edge networks efficiently, predict their access patterns and serve them efficiently. This alone may not be enough - for most of the world the only access to internet may be through a not-so-good mobile data network which might still be prohibitively expensive to stream high quality videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the second problem: video quality. Since most educational videos, unlike action movie frames, are to a large extent relatively slow moving and not lots of dynamic pixel changes, AI techniques used for &lt;em&gt;Super Resolution&lt;/em&gt; can be employed to create a higher resolution content on device even if the incoming videos from the nearest edge network are low resolution ones. But what about the device - does it need to be one with an expensive GPU attached to it? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the third problem: device specifications. The most desired characteristic of the device would be longer battery life and quick recharge capability. Since most education content (the content itself) is generated before the class (the event) and the content is just delivered live, modest processing power should be enough to do the inference side of super resolution. Chromebooks and android devices are a first step in this direction, but a main area of improvement would also be how long the device lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most students are visual learners but most educational content is dry. One could use components of game development engines to develop tools for teachers so that they can create interesting animations and content for their class without having to learn and program using game engines. We have been living with Powerpoint for content creation for more than three decades and may be it is time to add more interesting content creation capabilities to Powerpoint or move to an application that provides such capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most digital content is created in English, Mandarin and Spanish while there are many other languages and many research suggest that one’s first language is the best medium for early education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While translating languages from one to another automatically is not effective as of today, future AI technologies would hopefully be able to bridge this gap as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Students with special needs would require more help both from technology and human beings in order to enjoy and benefit from online education. If technology can leave more time for teachers they could invest that gained time on students with special needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other problems where technology could play a role. One could create authentication mechanisms for examinations and awarding certificate of completion of courses. Zoom like video conferencing technologies could be used both for delivering the content as well as break rooms for further guidance. Automated algorithms could test basics of the students’ knowledge of a topic and have progressively challenging exercises, rather than a one-size-fits-all teaching and evaluation model that is currently in place. A content created by one teacher or school can be securely shared with another school, optimizing the time and effort put in for content creation. The content itself could be stored in cloud storage and personalization algorithms could recommend what other YouTube or other content would be helpful in understanding the concepts in a specific topic, instead of the students straying all over the web looking for explanations to fortify their understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways things could improve. But in reality, most such softwares are fragmented. One might use a chromebook while the slides sent out by the teacher would be in powerpoint format, one video would be on YouTube, one would be lying as an mpeg file in a shared folder. One would use zoom and the other Webex or Teams and there is no way these applications are play well together. Further, the current techniques for first party and third party integrations of content creation and marketing might bump up content rich in marketing dollars while relatively punishing content rich in content. Nevertheless, technology would play a huge role not only in school education but also enterprise reskilling (education technology would be an enterprise product as well) and the one who wins would be the one who builds the strongest platform combining the disparate technologies listed above, and some more.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <updated>2020-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2020/06/06/evs</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/06/06/evs/">&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://dotkay.github.io/2020/06/01/covid-vs-coal/&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, we learnt something that we do not see everyday, even if we work in a coal mine, as the variety of energy and the consumption end points blind us from looking at the full picture. Today, we will look at some trends that we see all around us, all the time - Electric vehicles (EVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of us, an &lt;em&gt;electric car&lt;/em&gt; immediately reminds us of Tesla - the innovative American automobile manufacturer that is to become the world’s most valuable automobile company very soon. Tesla is also the company that created an electric car revolution. Tesla’s success, in many ways, drove other automakers to accelerate their offering of all-electric products. We saw that the transition was not overnight. Many built hybrid vehicles (HEV), range-extended electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV), before building all electric, or battery electric vehicles (BEV). However, if one is to guess which country on the planet has the most number of electric cars it would most likely be the US or EU, because of Tesla and the likes of VW or BMW (both of which make electric cars). Let’s see how the actual answer unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020&quot;&gt;IEA’s global outlook&lt;/a&gt; and data show some impressive numbers. To quote from their report,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Only about 17 000 electric cars were on the world’s roads in 2010. By 2019, that number had swelled to 7.2 million, 47% of which were in The People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/energy/evs.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;EVs in the world&quot; class=&quot;img=responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, despite purchase subsidies for electric cars were cut in many geographies (like tax credits in the US) and the resulting drop in electric car sales, the total number electric vehicles in China, EU and the US are still very impressive - 2.58 million BEVs in China compared to 0.88 million BEVs in the US and 0.97 million BEVs in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would start thinking what other industries are getting transformed along with the transformation of automotive industry. The implications of this transformation are huge touching several industries from service industry, retail and insurance. The analysis of the transformation itself would give fascninating insights. That would be the topic of a future post.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/06/01/covid-vs-coal/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Covid vs Coal" />
      <published>2020-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2020-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2020/06/01/covid-vs-coal</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/06/01/covid-vs-coal/">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to an interesting news program on renewable energy recently that made claims and projections about the current state and future of energy - primarily about renewable energy overtaking coal as the major source of energy. As a result of Covid, demand for electricity has fallen and as coal has become more and more expensive than renewable counterparts, coal based electricity is facing an uphill battle. Will coal survive the covid crisis, in developed countries, is yet to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prompted me to dig further into the data on energy production and consumption in the US. I was indeed surprised to see that coal based energy production is in fact decreasing in the US, and is decreasing drastically. I was surpised by two factors. First, I thought only under-developed or developing countries were the places where coal based energy was a major source, primarily due to the lack of infrastructure (like efficient transmission grids) and the cost of renewable energy (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.). Second, nuclear power production has flattened out somewhere in the last decade, and is now overtaken by renewable energy. With several nuclear power plants built over the decades, some of them dangerously &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42103936/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/what-are-odds-us-nuke-plants-ranked-quake-risk/&quot;&gt;close to fault lines&lt;/a&gt;, I was expecting more energy to be generated by nuclear plants. It turned out that was not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the data, coal production is indeed decreasing and at such a rate that it is almost close to what it was in the 1950s. While renewable energy is all set to overtake coal based energy and experts predict 2020 to be the year for this to happen. In fact, renewable energy production has already overtaken nuclear energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the above is certainly positive news, there are several other fossil fuels (natural gas, crude oil, etc.) just like there are several renewable energy sources (hydroelectric,  solar, wind, etc.). Looking at more details at the different sources of fossil fuels, although coal production has reduced, total fossil fuel production is still way more than renewable energy production as the following chart shows.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">I was listening to an interesting news program on renewable energy recently that made claims and projections about the current state and future of energy - primarily about renewable energy overtaking coal as the major source of energy. As a result of Covid, demand for electricity has fallen and as coal has become more and more expensive than renewable counterparts, coal based electricity is facing an uphill battle. Will coal survive the covid crisis, in developed countries, is yet to be seen. This prompted me to dig further into the data on energy production and consumption in the US. I was indeed surprised to see that coal based energy production is in fact decreasing in the US, and is decreasing drastically. I was surpised by two factors. First, I thought only under-developed or developing countries were the places where coal based energy was a major source, primarily due to the lack of infrastructure (like efficient transmission grids) and the cost of renewable energy (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.). Second, nuclear power production has flattened out somewhere in the last decade, and is now overtaken by renewable energy.

      <link href="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/05/25/online-education-part-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Online Education - 'Right'ing the Privilege" />
      <published>2020-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2020-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2020/05/25/online-education-part-1</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/05/25/online-education-part-1/">&lt;p&gt;As we have been watching over the years, quality education no longer requires us to move to a different city to attend a quality university. It is available right on our smart device. With several universities around the world having some set of courses that are offered online and with the growth of several companies like Udacity, Coursera, Udemy and the like offering MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) the scale of reach for quality education is also much bigger - after all no university classroom is equipped to handle a million students simultaneously. So it is fair to say that anyone anywhere can get access to quality education right at their fingertips. Or is it? Are we missing something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID pandemic has exposed the inqualities, not only in employment but also in access to quality education. With several schools shut, the only options several schools have is to deliver their courses online. While many schools themselves are not well equipped to deliver education as a digital service, many more students and their households do not have the means to provide them with the necessary infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study, McKinsey &amp;amp; Co. compared 6th grade performance under different scenarios - returning to classrooms in 2020, early 2021 and mid 2021 and the results are shocking. The report also computes the average months of learning lost, due to low-quality remote learning, to be about 7-11 months even if schools open in early 2021 for in person learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/tmp/main/misc/mckinsey_6th_grade_school.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also says that this can have a drastic impact on the future of students and thereby the GDP of the country, due to many students dropping out of school due to their inability to access education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/tmp/main/misc/mckinsey_gdp_loss_due_to_school.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these results might just be the tip of the iceberg. Even if the government is able to subsidise infrastructure needs for online education over the next several months, that alone is not going to solve the problem. The dynamics of online education, especially for younger children, have many challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a certain energy that is brought about by many teachers in the physical classroom, that motivates students to listen and learn. This is difficult for many teachers to replicate online.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just as not every YouTube video is interesting not every subject is going to be equally interesting when listened to online.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attention span of students away from a regular, formal school environment is going to be different (lower) and this would reduce the learning experience as well as the knowledge gained.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many schools and teachers may not be proficient or may not have the workforce to deal with the many system administration issues that need to be tackled in real-time for delivering classes online.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessing such online education also requires relatively stable devices - even if chromebooks are relatively cheaper, many households - especially in the developing world where tablets and chromebooks are still a discretionary expense.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many parts of the developing world also do not have the necessary internet infrastructure to handle streaming videos at a large scale. Note that the number of students in a class in the developing world is also large.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moving from blackboard teaching to digital content creation takes time and it is not always easy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some topics, like biology or chemistry labs, just cannot happen through remote learning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students with learning disabilities would need the teacher in person in order to be able to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these various challenges and the data and projections provided in McKinsey &amp;amp; Co.’s report, it is fair to say that (online) education is still a privilege and not a right. What possible solutions could local governments, corporations and teachers come up with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governments&lt;/strong&gt; could fast track the implementation of broadband networks, possibly by subsidising companies to do so in case the government is not able to do it themselves. Many other services, besides education, rely on efficient internet infrastructure and in the years to come, the number of services dependent on such infrastructure is only going to increase. They could also provide low income households with computing devices so that they can access education when delivered digitally. This reminds me of the days when state governments in India provided bicycles to students in government schools so that they can commute and access education provided in far away schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporations&lt;/strong&gt; could make devices exclusively for school students. These need to be rugged, inexpensive and with a long battery life. In order for this to be feasible as a business, corporations could:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the devices modular so that one could collect back damaged or older devices, recycle the parts into refurbished devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sacrifice non-essential elements that add up to the price (like different sets of fancy ports, etc.) for longer battery life and higher quality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Partner with school districts to loan such devices which could be collected back periodically for refurbishing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborate on creating uniform content creation tools that would enable the teachers to create interesting content faster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help teachers create engaging content from their knowledge of YouTube or Coursera views and feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teachers&lt;/strong&gt; could learn to create engaging digital content - stories, animations and charts that would capture the interests of students, increasing their attention span even when in an environment different from regular classrooms. Teachers could:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborate and share content so that they can spend more time focussing on students’ development and learning than creating content.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborate and share best practices so that new teachers or even volunteers can get better at keeping the students engaged and teach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a big role parents play in such situations, along with teachers. These are extraordinary times - while technologies like Zoom and Cloud computing allow many of us to work remotely, education is one domain where despite technological advancements several challenges remain to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <updated>2020-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2020/05/05/streaming-vs-cinema-post-covid</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/05/05/streaming-vs-cinema-post-covid/">&lt;p&gt;Watching a movie with stunning visual special effects, sound effects is best done in cinema halls. The screens are wide, the hall geometry and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theaterseatstore.com/blog/movie-sound-systems&quot;&gt;sound technologies&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;surrond sound&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; add to the experience. It is no surprise that movies like Jurrasic Park, Inception, Avengers, etc. are best watched on large screen, in cinemas. It is not just the story, it is the movie experience, besides the social aspect of being outside and the lights going down. US box office revenues were 11.32 billion USD in 2019 and 11.89 billion USD in 2018 (all time best).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, streaming has become very popular. It gives the convenience of watching the movie as and when one wanted, without having to drive to a cinema and at much lower price. A family of four can watch several movies in their living room for a monthly service fee of about $15, while a movie ticket would cost each of the family members as much. Added to this would be popcorn and soda. Netflix and lately almost every major studio is into streaming. Traditionally, movies were run in cinemas for about 90 days before getting released in digital format. But that 90 day “windowing” is coming under a lot of pressure with many streaming services deciding to release the movies right away in digital format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we have two interesting and opposing forces - cinema halls and streaming services. One provides the best experience while the other provides convenience and affordability. And then came the COVID pandemic. With cinema halls being the sort of place that by design invited a large gathering in an enclosed room, it provided the perfect recipe for a pandemic spread. Cinema halls are closed and people are stuck at home having not much of an entertainment - a perfect recipe for streaming services to be at their best to relieve those sheltering in place of their boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if the scenario is not interesting enough, it was rumored that a popular movie streaming service - Amazon Prime Video made a bid for a popular cinema chain AMC. Although nothing of this is confirmed, the very thought process in analyzing this is interesting. What would be Amazon’s interest in AMC?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon has a sizeable number of prime customers who get free shipping on goods and some deals on Whole Foods stores. Would Amazon give them monthly passes or subsidized tickets to watch movies in AMC?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon Studios makes originals. Would those originals first be released in AMC and later streamed on Amazon Prime?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would Amazon reserve AMC for the first few weeks, for movies with stellar visual and sound effects?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would Amazon split the Studio products into TV shows like soaps for Amazon Prime and movies for AMC?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would AMC become a Hollywood talent scouting arm for Amazon?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all these, how would the pricing work? Amazon is known for maximizing efficiency and getting the best price for the end customer. Would it be able to replicate it in box office movies? If so, how? It is an interesting aspect waiting to be seen, if the rumours are true and if the deal goes through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till then, relax on your couch and stream your favorite shows.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/04/01/efficiency-vs-flexibility/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Efficiency vs Flexibility" />
      <published>2020-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2020-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2020/04/01/efficiency-vs-flexibility</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/04/01/efficiency-vs-flexibility/">&lt;p&gt;Despite the date of posting, this post isn’t a joke and is meant to provoke some thoughts on efficiency and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of COVID-19 pandemic we saw the mad rush for toilet papers and other essentials that were getting swept off super-market shelves. Not just toilet papers, even face-masks and ventilators were in short supply at a time when they were most needed. Many consumer and semiconductor companies lowered their guidance due to disruptions in their supply chain. How did we get into a situation where so many industries - from toilet papers to iPhones were getting affected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world over the many years got more globalized. American or Canadian products were not made in the US or Canada. They were made in places where it was cheaper and faster to make. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8&quot;&gt;trash is sent to other countries&lt;/a&gt; in order to be recycled in a cost-effective manner. In short, global supply chain over the years shaped its goal into one that is more cost efficient rather than being flexible. This is not the first time companies are facing shocks. Not long ago, floods in Japan resulted in supply chain issues for automotive companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this design for efficiency a problem? It definitely looks like, given what many countries went through as the COVID-19 pandemic stuck. Many companies were not able to reliably source their material and keep their assembly lines busy, as they were over-invested in the most (cost) efficient supply chains like in China. If instead the supply chains were designed for flexibility, the average marginal cost of a product “might be” (and just might be) a little higher but geography specific events would not throw the entire system out of gear. There is an emphasis on the uncertainity of the cost implications as it is not entirely clear at this point. For example, one could argue that, if the semiconductor industry had sourced from several geographies like China, India, Africa, South America, etc., it is very likely that the infrastructure for sustaining such supply chains would have developed in many such countries creating a healthy competition, thereby reducing the cost. And this applies to several industries, not just semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have the corporates learnt a lesson now?. There was a similar talk after supply chain disruptions in Japan, but nothing materialized in the long run. Would this time be different? One has to wait and watch.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Many consumer and semiconductor companies lowered their guidance due to disruptions in their supply chain. How did we get into a situation where so many industries - from toilet papers to iPhones were getting affected? The world over the many years got more globalized. American or Canadian products were not made in the US or Canada. They were made in places where it was cheaper and faster to make. Even trash is sent to other countries in order to be recycled in a cost-effective manner. In short, global supply chain over the years shaped its goal into one that is more cost efficient rather than being flexible. This is not the first time companies are facing shocks. Not long ago, floods in Japan resulted in supply chain issues for automotive companies. Is this design for efficiency a problem? It definitely looks like, given what many countries went through as the COVID-19 pandemic stuck. Many companies were not able to reliably source their material and keep their assembly lines busy, as they were over-invested in the most (cost) efficient supply chains like in China. If instead the supply chains were designed for flexibility, the average marginal cost of a product “might be” (and just might be) a little higher but geography specific events would not throw the entire system out of gear. There is an emphasis on the uncertainity of the cost implications as it is not entirely clear at this point. For example, one could argue that, if the semiconductor industry had sourced from several geographies like China, India, Africa, South America, etc., it is very likely that the infrastructure for sustaining such supply chains would have developed in many such countries creating a healthy competition, thereby reducing the cost. And this applies to several industries, not just semiconductors. Have the corporates learnt a lesson now?. There was a similar talk after supply chain disruptions in Japan, but nothing materialized in the long run. Would this time be different? One has to wait and watch.</summary>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/03/15/market-returns-and-regression-betas/">&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dotkay.github.io/2020/03/01/market-returns-and-stocks&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; we saw how volatile a stock is, compared to a broader market performance, by plotting the percentage change in weekly returns of the stock prices. We were able to visually see that a certain stock was moving much more vigorously than the market (S&amp;amp;P 500 in that case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to see how to find and measure the movement of a particular stock with respect to the market. Is there a standardized measure? Suppose an investor who holds multiple assets wants to measure how much risk &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; particular asset adds to his portfolio, is there a way he can quantify the risk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Statistically, &lt;em&gt;covariance&lt;/em&gt; of an asset measures how much the asset moves compared to market movements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beta&lt;/em&gt; is a standardized measure of this covariance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;        covariance of asset with market 
Beta =  ---------------------------------
            variance of the market
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we have market returns data that we used in our previous plot, we can run a regression on this data and try to fit a straight line to the data points in our dataset. The slope of the regression is the &lt;em&gt;Beta&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;R_asset = alpha + beta * R_market
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statsmodels.org&quot;&gt;statsmodels&lt;/a&gt; library to compute a linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;statsmodels.api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sp500_returns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nvda_returns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add_constant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nvda_reg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OLS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;endog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nvda_reg_model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nvda_reg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nvda_reg_model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we used (percentage change in ) &lt;em&gt;adjusted closing prices&lt;/em&gt; in our returns (with the column name ‘Adj Close’ in our dataframe), we see that the &lt;em&gt;beta&lt;/em&gt; of NVIDIA stock during the period of the regression (2015-2019) is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.79&lt;/code&gt;. We also see the R-squared value of our regression which turns out to be 0.265 and this indicates that 26.5% of the risk can be attributed to the market risk while the remaining &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;73.5%&lt;/code&gt; of the risk is firm specific. We also see the P value of our regression and a bunch of other details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also plot our regression:&lt;/p&gt;

                 &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;reg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fit_reg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

      <published>2020-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2020-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2020/03/01/market-returns-and-stocks</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2020/03/01/market-returns-and-stocks/">&lt;p&gt;I recently started learning about stock prices, market returns and how risk is measured. I am still in the process of learning about it and I hope to add more to my knowledge in the following months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many stock indices to look for how the general market is performing. More often, we hear about DOW index (DJIA - Dow Jones Industrial Average) down or NASDAQ up and so on. But NASDAQ is a technology firm heavy listing - i.e. the movement of the NASDAQ index would indicate the movement of technology sector to a large extent. While DJIA is a more general mix of stocks, it is price weighted and so companies with a higher stock price or extreme price movements would influence the movement more. Another common index is the S&amp;amp;P 500 (Standard and Poor’s 500) Index. S&amp;amp;P 500 is weighted by market value of the companies rather than the stock prices. So, a 5% movement of a $200 stock would affect the index the same way as a 5% movement of a $100 stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us see how the weekly percentage change in returns of one of the stocks (NVDA) compares to the percentage returns of the S&amp;amp;P 500 returns (usually referred to as &lt;em&gt;market returns&lt;/em&gt;), over a period of about five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sp500_returns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sp500_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Adj Close'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pct_change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nvda_returns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nvda_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Adj Close'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pct_change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sp500_returns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'S&amp;amp;P 500'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nvda_returns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'NVDA'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/fin_data_analysis/main/nvda_vs_sp500.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above plot shows you how much NVDA (NVIDIA stock prices) fluctuate more than the general market (S&amp;amp;P 500 price index). If the stock is too volatile, it might be because of some risk associated with that stock, some portion of which can be explained by market movements and some portion specific to the company’s internal risk. &lt;em&gt;Beta&lt;/em&gt; is typically used as a measure of risk, which we will compute in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <summary type="html">I recently started learning about stock prices, market returns and how risk is measured. I am still in the process of learning about it and I hope to add more to my knowledge in the following months. There are many stock indices to look for how the general market is performing. More often, we hear about DOW index (DJIA - Dow Jones Industrial Average) down or NASDAQ up and so on. But NASDAQ is a technology firm heavy listing - i.e. the movement of the NASDAQ index would indicate the movement of technology sector to a large extent. While DJIA is a more general mix of stocks, it is price weighted and so companies with a higher stock price or extreme price movements would influence the movement more. Another common index is the S&amp;amp;P 500 (Standard and Poor’s 500) Index. S&amp;amp;P 500 is weighted by market value of the companies rather than the stock prices. So, a 5% movement of a $200 stock would affect the index the same way as a 5% movement of a $100 stock. Let us see how the weekly percentage change in returns of one of the stocks (NVDA) compares to the percentage returns of the S&amp;amp;P 500 returns (usually referred to as market returns), over a period of about five years. ... sp500_returns = sp500_df['Adj Close'].pct_change()[1:] nvda_returns = nvda_df['Adj Close'].pct_change()[1:] ... ... sp500_returns.plot(label='S&amp;amp;P 500') nvda_returns.plot(label='NVDA') The above plot shows you how much NVDA (NVIDIA stock prices) fluctuate more than the general market (S&amp;amp;P 500 price index). If the stock is too volatile, it might be because of some risk associated with that stock, some portion of which can be explained by market movements and some portion specific to the company’s internal risk. Beta is typically used as a measure of risk, which we will compute in a future post.</summary>

      <link href="https://dotkay.github.io/2019/12/01/linkedin-business/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LinkedIn's Business" />
      <published>2019-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2019-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2019/12/01/linkedin-business</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2019/12/01/linkedin-business/">&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have been reading about several businesses and trying to understand their product offerings, value proposition of the products, business model and how they came to be. With a natural inclination for technology products and a curiosity about startups and business models, this has been an enjoyable learning experience and I am hoping to share a lot of my learning through this medium. Let’s start with LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn’s Vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;I liked the simple and clear vision statement but was wondering why it mentions only &lt;em&gt;economic opportunity&lt;/em&gt; while LinkedIn’s products offer much more or could it be the case that all the benefits the products offer can be tied to economic opportunity? I started researching about what this term &lt;em&gt;economic opportunity&lt;/em&gt; entails and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-are-economic-opportunities-defined&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; in Quora:&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When somebody is willing to pay you money for doing something that you are willing and able to do, that is an “economic opportunity”. It can be a small business idea or a job.If you can produce a product or provide a service that people are willing to pay for, that is a small business opportunity. If you have an ability or skill that an employer needs, that is a job opportunity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basically, an economic opportunity is the chance to do work that somebody is willing to pay you for. You don’t have to “like” the work. You just have to be able to competently do it. If you like your work, all the better for you. But we work to earn money that is paid by other people. The work we do is for other people’s benefit. The money they pay us is for our benefit. It is a reciprocal pay-earn, demand-supply economic relationship. They pay us money for supplying them what they want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, however, feel that LinkedIn also provides knowledge opportunity (learning), business/marketing opportunity (sales leads) and career opportunity (jobs for professionals) and talent development (hiring solutions for recruiters) opportunity, etc. There might be some or some aspects of these on which you cannot really put a dollar value on in order for them to be called an &lt;em&gt;economic opportunity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn’s Mission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The mission of LinkedIn is simple: connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, a short and crisp mission statement. But, again I believe that the main benefit is making professionals more skilled, equipped, informed, etc., rather than just productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn’s Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn to many is just a networking site for professionals. But once you look at the suite of products it is much more than that. LinkedIn’s products are organized under four themes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Market&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sell&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various products under each of these themes are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/products/linkedin_products.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LinkedIn's Products&quot; class=&quot;img=responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to categorize each of the products into &lt;em&gt;advertisement-based&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;subscription-based&lt;/em&gt; one as some of them overlap both business models. The &lt;em&gt;HIRE&lt;/em&gt; theme is mainly for human resources professionals to track, follow, and manage recruiting pipeline for their organizations. I believe this could be one of the most active products (along with learning) on the platform. The &lt;em&gt;MARKET&lt;/em&gt; theme helps in setting up marketing campaigns, reach out to potential resources for marketing purposes, set up custom pages, and serve advertisements on the pages and possibly through emails. Although it sounds like a lot of features, I believe they would have a very stiff competition from the likes of Google and Facebook. Although the advertisements would be more relevant to hiring and professional marketing, the eyeballs on these wouldn’t be as much as on Google search and Facebook feeds. However, with the volume of professionals in the network, hiring ads would get the best reach on this platform. The &lt;em&gt;SELL&lt;/em&gt; theme sounds like a specialized Salesforce platform.  The &lt;em&gt;LEARN&lt;/em&gt; theme is an upcoming Coursera. Although it may not offer a wide variety of specializations for now, with data from the &lt;em&gt;HIRE&lt;/em&gt; theme, it would be a more powerful medium for specialized skill development targeted at specific job roles in specific industries. We need to wait and watch how well Microsoft uses the data from one to better the offerings of another. Although LinkedIn membership is free, there is also a premium subscription which could be considered as a separate product in itself (creating significant revenue) and it is needed to use several of the other products, for example InMail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn’s business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;LinkedIn has become a significant business unit of Microsoft. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the 2019 fiscal year, LinkedIn brought in $6.8 billion worth of revenue, contributing to $38.1 billion of commercial cloud revenue for Microsoft, which in turn made up part of $126 billion total revenue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further the numbers below from Microsoft’s earnings and LinkedIn newsroom validate the importance of LinkedIn and its potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/products/linkedin_fy20_q1.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;LinkedIn FY20 Q1&quot; class=&quot;img=responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/products/linkedin_stats.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;LinkedIn impact&quot; class=&quot;img=responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn’s Opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/products/linkedin_worldwide.png&quot; alt=&quot;LinkedIn Stats&quot; class=&quot;img=responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that shows the opportunity for LinkedIn. Along with the above, GitHub - the world’s largest software development platform or the playground for developers was snapped up by Microsoft. This indicates a very huge potential. The data from &lt;em&gt;HIRE&lt;/em&gt; theme above combined with &lt;em&gt;LEARN&lt;/em&gt; theme and fueled by GitHub platform is a wonderful growth opportunity. GitHub + LinkedIn for developers would be Instagram for fashionistas and for businesses and recruiters this would be the Instagram for fashion brands seeking ambassadors and influencers. Probably some day very soon let me write about the opportunity for data science and AI in stitching all the above products together as one awesome fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats all for now!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2019/07/01/mmt/">&lt;p&gt;As people who know me understand, I read articles and listen to podcasts on a variety of topics ranging from technology, social science, society, economics, etc. Economics is one of my favourites, as it is very relatable to our day to day lives, besides involving mathematical modelling (which, for the same reasons as Deep Learning techniques of today, can only be close to a very good approximation but never accurate). While listening to BBC’s Business Daily podcasts, I stumbled upon this episode on Modern Monetary Theory. The title of the podcast - “Magic Money Tree” caught my attention and it turned out to be an interesting take on a proposal by one of the former Hedge Fund manager about central banks being able to print more money when needed. I did have this idea when I was a kid before I realized inflation and value of goods and how they are tied to abundance of ciculation of money, interest rates and consumer spending. I am not an economist but I am worried how this could lead to powerful economies manipulating their inflation thereby leading to disastrous consequences in parts of the world whose currencies are not global trade currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <published>2019-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2019-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2019/05/01/ai-decision-systems-and-adjudications</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2019/05/01/ai-decision-systems-and-adjudications/">&lt;p&gt;We have seen the benefits of deploying technology in many real world applications. Anyone who has used Yelp or IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes before deciding on a restaurant or watching a movie has accepted the indirect aid the (average) ratings on those sites provided about the quality of the restaurant or the movie. Anyone who has watched sports like Cricket, Tennis or Football (soccer) would be able to appreciate the role Hawk-Eye technology plays in resolving decision confusions by on-field referees or umpires. One just wonders how much of technology is used in other adjudications (like lawsuits, for example) and how technology can aid (rather than replace) such adjudications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us take an example of such an adjudication - for example, a dispute between two parties (very much like two teams in a sport) being resolved by an adjudicator (like an on-field referee or an umpire).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In many sports, technology plays a huge role in aiding the on-field umpire or even over-turning the decisions of the on-field umpire when one of the parties was not satisfied with his original decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cricket, this is referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is8Vd_YQKwE&quot;&gt;Decision Review System (DRS)&lt;/a&gt; - which in turn uses several technologies like Hawk-Eye vision cameras, ball tracking technology and projection and estimation of the movement of the ball beyond the point of obstruction. How do we generalize this for any adjudication process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown below is a general flow of what a simplified process would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Components of a Decision System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/tmp/main/ideas/adj_tech.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigation Facts&lt;/strong&gt; These are the facts coming out of an investigation. In sports, these could be coming from several cameras and ball tracking systems. In a civil or criminal lawsuit this could be the facts compiled by a set of investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptable Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt; These are the &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; rules of the game. In sports, these could be coming from the rule book. In a lawsuit these could be the set of rules acceptable by law (and not necessarily by society).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact Compiler&lt;/strong&gt; is the brain of the system. It compiles the several statements in natural language into unambiguous statements in logic as a first step so that clear interpretation could be made. Then, a comparision of investigation facts against the rules of the game is made to see if all the rules were obeyed or some were not obeyed. The comparision tells us that happened that were actually allowed by the rules of the game (or by law) and what were disallowed by law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the two parties involved in the dispute can use such a &lt;em&gt;Fact Compiler&lt;/em&gt; in order to compile their facts and check what was compromised and what rules were obeyed. There might be rule breaks that one party thinks was the right thing to do and needs an adjudicator to decide taking into account the situation under which the rule break happened (injuring another person during an act of self defence, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Systems&lt;/strong&gt;
Now, the decision making system has at least three sets of facts to compare - the compiled facts from each of the two parties involved in the dispute, and the fundamental truth compiled from independent investigation and acceptable (lawful) behaviours. The decision making system can compare these three sets of facts and enumerate the lawful and unlawful behaviours (w.r.t the truth as known to the investigation compared against acceptable legal behaviours). An adjudicator can consult this set of facts in order to avoid his own bias before making an adjudication. Purists might point out that this would not reduce bias as the bias introduced by investigation and fact compiler might indeed propagate to the compiled set of facts, and that is true. The effort to reduce the bias at these stages is to make the Fact Compiler and the input facts less biased by providing “more”, “unbiased” data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Language Understanding&lt;/strong&gt;
While understanding natural language with context is a challenging area of Computer Science and Mathematical logic, this would pave way for an interesting area of research to encode the contexts and use that encoding while building technologies to understand natural language. One of the simplest examples why this is a challenge is to just look at the following pairs of sentences (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_flies_like_an_arrow;_fruit_flies_like_a_banana&quot;&gt;inspired by this&lt;/a&gt;)and guess an appropriate word for the blank in the second statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Time flies like an arrow
Fruit flies like a _______
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most AI systems would not guess the blank as a fruit, let alone one that rhymes with &lt;em&gt;arrow&lt;/em&gt; (like &lt;em&gt;mango&lt;/em&gt;). The word “like”, though the same word and spelling in both cases, alters the meaning of the statements that pure structural analysis would not help one in completing the second one. We need some semantics and context behind the statements. Another example would be to check if a given statement is a sarcastic one or a serious one. Sarcasm detection, though there are partially successful approaches, is a challenging area for natural language understanding systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Reasoning Engines, Logic and Encoding Facts&lt;/strong&gt;
Many of the reasoning engines built for reasoning about the correct of computer programs (a set of program statements with a specific syntax (syntax of the programming language), much like the set of facts in English) work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manyworldsoflogic.com/predicateLogic.html&quot;&gt;predicate logic&lt;/a&gt; and there are well known automated solvers to solve a set of facts encoded in this logic. However, encoding contexts and possibilities would involve more than just predicate logic - it might involve modal logic and epistemic logic. A single reasoning engine would do the logical consistency check and derive the consequences (a set of facts) from known facts (provided by the supporting documents) based on encodings of rules of law (the axioms). Once the individual facts from investigations are compiled into precise mathematical statements by the &lt;em&gt;Fact Compiler&lt;/em&gt;, rather than ambiguous English statements, the checker can be implemented using technologies behind reasoning engines used in program verification. While research in this area is progressing, it is also important to keep an eye on the applications - like lawsuits as legal statements in English language might require more effort to encode rather than informal statements in English language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While aiding an adjudicator is an important part of the technology, encoding the facts, at each level of the process, as statements in mathematical logic would allow allow one to play back the compiled judgement (a set of facts) to understand how those facts were arrived at, from the initial sets of facts (like investigations and laws).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be a huge step in explaining the decision made (this would be the cornerstone of an explainable AI system). It would also provide a valuable tool for adjudicators to replay different decisions to check if they would be consistent with the initial sets of facts, or even replay them with some facts removed or altered to explain how the decision would have been different in case one of the parties had done something different (been more lawful instead of breaking the law).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <summary type="html">We have seen the benefits of deploying technology in many real world applications. Anyone who has used Yelp or IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes before deciding on a restaurant or watching a movie has accepted the indirect aid the (average) ratings on those sites provided about the quality of the restaurant or the movie. Anyone who has watched sports like Cricket, Tennis or Football (soccer) would be able to appreciate the role Hawk-Eye technology plays in resolving decision confusions by on-field referees or umpires. One just wonders how much of technology is used in other adjudications (like lawsuits, for example) and how technology can aid (rather than replace) such adjudications. Let us take an example of such an adjudication - for example, a dispute between two parties (very much like two teams in a sport) being resolved by an adjudicator (like an on-field referee or an umpire). In many sports, technology plays a huge role in aiding the on-field umpire or even over-turning the decisions of the on-field umpire when one of the parties was not satisfied with his original decision. In cricket, this is referred to as Decision Review System (DRS) - which in turn uses several technologies like Hawk-Eye vision cameras, ball tracking technology and projection and estimation of the movement of the ball beyond the point of obstruction. How do we generalize this for any adjudication process. Shown below is a general flow of what a simplified process would look like. Components of a Decision System Investigation Facts These are the facts coming out of an investigation. In sports, these could be coming from several cameras and ball tracking systems. In a civil or criminal lawsuit this could be the facts compiled by a set of investigators. Acceptable Behaviours These are the fair rules of the game. In sports, these could be coming from the rule book. In a lawsuit these could be the set of rules acceptable by law (and not necessarily by society). Fact Compiler is the brain of the system. It compiles the several statements in natural language into unambiguous statements in logic as a first step so that clear interpretation could be made. Then, a comparision of investigation facts against the rules of the game is made to see if all the rules were obeyed or some were not obeyed. The comparision tells us that happened that were actually allowed by the rules of the game (or by law) and what were disallowed by law. Each of the two parties involved in the dispute can use such a Fact Compiler in order to compile their facts and check what was compromised and what rules were obeyed. There might be rule breaks that one party thinks was the right thing to do and needs an adjudicator to decide taking into account the situation under which the rule break happened (injuring another person during an act of self defence, for example). Decision Systems Now, the decision making system has at least three sets of facts to compare - the compiled facts from each of the two parties involved in the dispute, and the fundamental truth compiled from independent investigation and acceptable (lawful) behaviours. The decision making system can compare these three sets of facts and enumerate the lawful and unlawful behaviours (w.r.t the truth as known to the investigation compared against acceptable legal behaviours). An adjudicator can consult this set of facts in order to avoid his own bias before making an adjudication. Purists might point out that this would not reduce bias as the bias introduced by investigation and fact compiler might indeed propagate to the compiled set of facts, and that is true. The effort to reduce the bias at these stages is to make the Fact Compiler and the input facts less biased by providing “more”, “unbiased” data. Natural Language Understanding While understanding natural language with context is a challenging area of Computer Science and Mathematical logic, this would pave way for an interesting area of research to encode the contexts and use that encoding while building technologies to understand natural language. One of the simplest examples why this is a challenge is to just look at the following pairs of sentences (inspired by this)and guess an appropriate word for the blank in the second statement: Time flies like an arrow Fruit flies like a _______ Most AI systems would not guess the blank as a fruit, let alone one that rhymes with arrow (like mango). The word “like”, though the same word and spelling in both cases, alters the meaning of the statements that pure structural analysis would not help one in completing the second one. We need some semantics and context behind the statements. Another example would be to check if a given statement is a sarcastic one or a serious one. Sarcasm detection, though there are partially successful approaches, is a challenging area for natural language understanding systems. Automated Reasoning Engines, Logic and Encoding Facts Many of the reasoning engines built for reasoning about the correct of computer programs (a set of program statements with a specific syntax (syntax of the programming language), much like the set of facts in English) work on predicate logic and there are well known automated solvers to solve a set of facts encoded in this logic. However, encoding contexts and possibilities would involve more than just predicate logic - it might involve modal logic and epistemic logic. A single reasoning engine would do the logical consistency check and derive the consequences (a set of facts) from known facts (provided by the supporting documents) based on encodings of rules of law (the axioms). Once the individual facts from investigations are compiled into precise mathematical statements by the Fact Compiler, rather than ambiguous English statements, the checker can be implemented using technologies behind reasoning engines used in program verification. While research in this area is progressing, it is also important to keep an eye on the applications - like lawsuits as legal statements in English language might require more effort to encode rather than informal statements in English language. While aiding an adjudicator is an important part of the technology, encoding the facts, at each level of the process, as statements in mathematical logic would allow allow one to play back the compiled judgement (a set of facts) to understand how those facts were arrived at, from the initial sets of facts (like investigations and laws). This would be a huge step in explaining the decision made (this would be the cornerstone of an explainable AI system). It would also provide a valuable tool for adjudicators to replay different decisions to check if they would be consistent with the initial sets of facts, or even replay them with some facts removed or altered to explain how the decision would have been different in case one of the parties had done something different (been more lawful instead of breaking the law).</summary>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got into this discussion over lunch when I heard about the Netflix series “Black Mirror” which allows the audience to choose among a set of possible story endings. This is an excellent development, in my view, in that it not only brings more suspense and interest or attention to the content, on the lighter side it would also prevent spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsable.asianetnews.com/kerala/after-solo-other-malayalam-films-supposed-to-have-different-endings&quot;&gt;south Indian movies that had different climaxes&lt;/a&gt; (although to appease the fan base in different regions), I have always wondered why not have multiple possibilities for a movie climax and serve (stream) the appropriate one depending on the goal of the movie audience - i.e., if the goal is to just watch the movie and return home happy, one could have a happy ending, if the viewer is adventurous or an FPS gamer, one could have a violent or tragic ending, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have personalization using big data analytics everywhere, it should be possible for a streaming service to identify the likes and dislikes of the audience based on previous perferences, reviews, age, likes, and the many similar features to identify the best climax for each specific viewer, besides providing the viewer the choice to choose from alternate climaxes. Of course, the cost is in the making of several different versions of a movie or TV series which in a way could be reduced using today’s CGI that only gets better over time. The upshot would be more viewership and more discussion centered around the various climaxes. Instead of viewers just watching the movie and rating them, each different climax of the same movie would get rated by different personalities. Such a service could also stream a movie ending in such a way as to cheer you up when you are dull or to pump you up when you are demotivated. Movies will never be the same again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If such a personalization of streaming content were to happen who would lead the way? Would it be Amazon Fire TV who has the machine learning backend to make personalization happen, NetFlix who has the influence to get the producers to make several interesting versions of a movie or TV series or Apple TV service if Apple were to get its innovation crown back? What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2019/01/01/privacy-and-security/">&lt;p&gt;Happy New year friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a year 2018 has been for the topic of privacy and security - from the most loved &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html&quot;&gt;social network&lt;/a&gt; scrambling for clues to save themselves to the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/10/google-to-shut-down-early-after-privacy-flaw-affects-over-50m-users&quot;&gt;social network&lt;/a&gt; built by the world’s best engineers still couldn’t save their data, besides struggling to stay relevant. While Europe was quick to pass &lt;a href=&quot;https://eugdpr.org/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, many other countries even in the developed world are yet to catch up with such laws and regulations. 2018 was also the year that saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/28/smart-speakers-hit-critical-mass-in-2018/&quot;&gt;surge in smart speakers&lt;/a&gt; and home automation - isn’t that ironic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this story is not about the past, but about the future. Many top technology and auto companies rushing to fulfill the promise of self-driving or autonomous vehicles. It will definitely become a reality, to some extent, in at least the parts of the world where the infrastructure supports it. But the notion of foolproof security for such a technology is far from being achieved. With smartphone apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Google+ security issues, we have only scratched the surface of the malevolent intent that is possible. Once autonomous vehicles and other IoT devices reach critical mass, the security issues are only going to multiply manifold and the impact of security flaws can have disastrous consequences. Imagine a malicious attacker taking control of traffic lights that talk to cars or cars talking to other cars to negotiate who gets to cross an intersection, or a mass rapid transit system that reroutes itself or changes frequency of rides depending on real-time ridership information using neural network based predictions. Imagine the impact of such a thing gone wrong. With the current day deep learning algorithms themselves not being tractable (i.e. one can not reliably track the computation from input data to the prediction step by step as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://skymind.ai/wiki/symbolic-reasoning&quot;&gt;symbolic AI&lt;/a&gt;) it is going to be more challenging to resolve a security issue even after having identified it. Apologies for being pessimistic - but one should see this as a challenge for computer architecture and computer security research - a great time to be working in any of these fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you want a job for the next one year, learn web/mobile app development, if you need a job for the next five years, train yourself with deep learning skills, if you need a job for the rest of your life, start working on computer security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <link href="https://dotkay.github.io/2018/11/11/water-connection/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cost-efficient Water Connections" />
      <published>2018-11-11T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2018-11-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://dotkay.github.io/2018/11/11/water-connection</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://dotkay.github.io/2018/11/11/water-connection/">&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are the tech-savvy engineer recruited by Public Works Department in your rural county. The rural county has wonderful flora, fauna and a few environmentalists and ecologists have been recruited to take care of the environment. There are a few houses built to host these people. Since the settlement is very new, the county has asked you to design a efficient water connection map to bring water to these settlements from a water source at one corner of the area. There are known paths where these water pipelines could be laid in a way that will have minimal effect on the environment. And you have been entrusted with using some of these paths in such a way as to minimise the cost and at the same time make sure every house gets a water connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img_container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotkay/tmp/main/algo_illustrations/kruskal_mst_1.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sit down and think that the map is nothing but an implicit graph, the cost of laying the pipelines being the weights on the graph’s edges. The vertices are the houses. You have one special vertex which is the community’s source of water. Your plan is to find the path from the source of water to every house in the community. Further, there might be several such paths and you would have to choose the one that has the lowest cost. You recall algorithms for minimum spanning trees that you had learned in your algorithms lessons a decade ago and decide to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algorithmically, you have a set of edges with weights, a set of vertices and a special start vertex. Suppose each edge is defined by a source vertex &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;, a destination vertex &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; and the associated cost of laying the pipe between these vertices &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/code&gt; - represented by the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-cpp&quot; data-lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Edge&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our graph is defined by the total set of vertices &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; (one source of water + the nodes representing houses) and a vector of Edges &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EdgeList&lt;/code&gt; each element is an Edge as defined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-cpp&quot; data-lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Graph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Edge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;edges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume that we also have a UnionFind data structure for us to use. Since we have to minimize the cost of construction, we try a greedy approach by picking the least expensive pipelines first - i.e., we sort &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;edges&lt;/code&gt; in increasing order of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we pick the least cost edge, the next least cost edge may not be a neighbour of the current edge (i.e. having a common &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; vertex). In order to prevent cycles, we maintain a UnionFind data structure and keep adding the (minimum cost) edges we choose. As we collect the minimum cost edges, we can compute the cost using an accumulator.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Suppose you are the tech-savvy engineer recruited by Public Works Department in your rural county. The rural county has wonderful flora, fauna and a few environmentalists and ecologists have been recruited to take care of the environment. There are a few houses built to host these people. Since the settlement is very new, the county has asked you to design a efficient water connection map to bring water to these settlements from a water source at one corner of the area. There are known paths where these water pipelines could be laid in a way that will have minimal effect on the environment. And you have been entrusted with using some of these paths in such a way as to minimise the cost and at the same time make sure every house gets a water connection. You sit down and think that the map is nothing but an implicit graph, the cost of laying the pipelines being the weights on the graph’s edges. The vertices are the houses. You have one special vertex which is the community’s source of water. Your plan is to find the path from the source of water to every house in the community. Further, there might be several such paths and you would have to choose the one that has the lowest cost. You recall algorithms for minimum spanning trees that you had learned in your algorithms lessons a decade ago and decide to give it a go. Algorithmically, you have a set of edges with weights, a set of vertices and a special start vertex. Suppose each edge is defined by a source vertex src, a destination vertex dest and the associated cost of laying the pipe between these vertices cost - represented by the following structure: struct Edge { int src; int dest; int cost; }; And our graph is defined by the total set of vertices V (one source of water + the nodes representing houses) and a vector of Edges EdgeList each element is an Edge as defined above. Graph(int V, std::vector&amp;lt;Edge&amp;gt; edges) Assume that we also have a UnionFind data structure for us to use. Since we have to minimize the cost of construction, we try a greedy approach by picking the least expensive pipelines first - i.e., we sort edges in increasing order of cost. std::sort(EdgeList.begin(), EdgeList.end(), [](Edge e1, Edge e2) { return e1.cost &amp;lt; e2.cost; }); Once we pick the least cost edge, the next least cost edge may not be a neighbour of the current edge (i.e. having a common src or dest vertex). In order to prevent cycles, we maintain a UnionFind data structure and keep adding the (minimum cost) edges we choose. As we collect the minimum cost edges, we can compute the cost using an accumulator. int Graph::kruskal_mst() { int V = size; UnionFind uf(V); std::sort(EdgeList.begin(), EdgeList.end(), [](Edge e1, Edge e2) { return e1.cost &amp;lt; e2.cost; }); int mst_cost = 0; int n = EdgeList.size(); for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++) { Edge e = EdgeList[i]; // min cost edge if (!uf.isSameSet(e.src, e.dest)) { mst_cost += e.cost; uf.formUnion(e.src, e.dest); } } return mst_cost; } Finally, we will end up with the following minimum cost spanning tree, with pipelines laid with a total cost of $990000.</summary>
